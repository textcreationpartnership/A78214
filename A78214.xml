         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>KNowing, that ſhortly I muſt put off this my Tabernacle, even as my Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ſhewed me, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14; I have endeavoured that you may be able after my Deceaſe, to have thoſe things always in Remembrance, which I have Taught unto you: In order to it, I have Selected and Contracted the choiſeſt, and moſt neceſſary Truths to be Known, Believed, and Practiſed by you, for the furthering of the Edification, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and Salvation of your Souls. I have done all very briefly, plainly, and by way of Meditation. If you deſire to know
<pb facs="tcp:152821:3"/>the Reaſons of my ſo doing, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all to Writing; you may be pleaſed to take this ſhort Account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I have done it ſo briefly, that I might not burden your Memories, and that your Heads and Hearts might be the more intent on the moſt ſpecial things; ſuch as are of neareſt, and greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to your Souls; and I hope that I may ſay without Boaſting, that I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Much in a Little; and if you will but weigh well what I have Written, you may find a great deal more Matter than Words. I have backed all with Scripture-Proofs, (ſome with more, ſome with leſs) that ſo you might the more clearly ſee the Truth of all; only citing the Text, not the Words (but only to ſome places) that ſo the Book may not ſwell too big.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I have done it in ſo plain, and familiar a Style, that I might condeſcend to the Capacity of the meaneſt Schollar in Chriſt's School; and becauſe Truth, when it is in the plaineſt Dreſs, is moſt Comely. It's a ſigne of a Weak Stomack, to mind more the Garniſhing of the Diſh, than the Meat in it; the ſin of too many here, and every where, to Like the Dreſſing more than the Food; and to look more to the Words
<pb facs="tcp:152821:3"/>than to the Matter; and therefore my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour hath been to do what the Wiſe Preacher did before me, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.10. <hi>The Preacher ſought out Acceptable Words, even <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright Words of Truth;</hi> that is, profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and Comfortable Words, True and Faithful Words, that ſo I might, <hi>Prodeſſe magis quam placere; non alta, ſed apta pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre;</hi> not High words, but Fit words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as Good Matter without Fit Words, is but as Good Meat in a Sluttiſh Diſh; ſo Neat words without Solid Matter, is but <hi>Copioſa egeſtas,</hi> a Gaudy Poverty; both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether are moſt acceptable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I have done it by way of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, becauſe it is only Meditation that brings home any Truth to the Heart, and makes it uſeful, and profitable; the Bee which only lights on the Flower, and doth not ſtay on it, gathers no Honey; it is her abiding a while on it, that ſucks out the Sweet of it: That Perſon that takes a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, and holds it only a little while in his Mouth, and then puts it out, will find little benefit by it; ſo will He that Hears and Reads the Word and never Meditates on it: it's only Meditation, that makes every Truth ſweet and profitable; and becauſe (what <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayes of Faith, is true
<pb facs="tcp:152821:4"/>of Meditation) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it doth make God, and Chriſt, his Precepts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and all we See, and Hear, and Read, to be ours; it applies, and digeſts, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilates us into the Nature of thoſe Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and Heavenly things we meditate on, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I have put all in Writing. 1. Becauſe as <hi>Abel by his Faith being dead, yet ſpeaketh,</hi> Heb. 11.4. So, this Treatiſe may ſpeak, and live, when I am dead; as Chriſt and his Apoſtles, now in Heaven; yet by their Doctrine, Examples, and Writings they preach unto the Saints on Earth. 2. That ſo what hath ſlipped out of your car, might be recalled by the eye <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.51. <hi>and the Eye might affect the Heart,</hi> with what you have formerly heard. A good mans Words may paſs as Wind in the Aire, when what he Writes, may prove of <hi>weight on the Heart,</hi> as the Apoſtle's words did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10. Whence it is that Sacraments (ſay ſome) excel Sermons, becauſe in Sermons Truths are only Audible to the Eare; but in Sacraments, things are Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Eye. 3. Becauſe by Writing, Miniſters they communicate their Labours not only to thoſe at home, but abroad; and ſo profit more by their Writing, than they
<pb facs="tcp:152821:4"/>do ſometimes by their Preaching. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by Writing, a Miniſters Labours are more permanent, and abiding upon the Heads, and Hearts of thoſe that make uſe of them: Sermons (as one, Well) are as Showrs of Rain, that Water for the preſent, when-as Books are as Banks, and Heaps of Snow, that lye long on the Earth, and keeps the Corn more warm in the Winter. In all theſe reſpects, I have put Pen to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and communicated theſe Meditations to your Eye, as well as your Ear.</p>
            <p>If any object, There are Books enough Printed, and of this Subject alſo of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. I grant it; I am of his Judgment who ſaid, For <hi>Polemical Tractates</hi> (which hold up different Opinions) <hi>A few are too many,</hi> but for Practical Treatiſes (which preſs to the Duties of Holineſs) <hi>Many are too few,</hi> which made <hi>Auſtin</hi> to ſay, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tile eſt plures libros, à pluribus fieri,</hi> the more, the better, ſo long as they are helps to the promoting of Godlineſs. The Reaſons is obvious, becauſe we find by ſad, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Experience, though moſt are willing to know, yet very few are forward to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe what they know, and therefore all helps little enough to quicken them to Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; And the rather, becauſe what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:152821:5"/>ſaid of his <hi>Ethicks,</hi> is much more true of Gods, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it's not Knowledge, but practiſe that denominates, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences any to be a truly knowing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and Religious Man. <hi>He that knows Gods will, and doth it not, is a Lyar,</hi> 1 E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, <hi>John</hi> 2.4. <hi>A Fool, Math.</hi> 7.27. and worſe than ſo: the more any knows without Practiſe, the more like he is to the Devil, who knows more than any, but practiſeth nothing; beſides, there's nothing will more aggravate the ſin, and Condemnation of Men at the laſt, than this, <hi>That they have known ſo much, and practiſed ſo little,</hi> Luke 12.48. <hi>Math.</hi> 10.14, 15. <hi>Heathens</hi> at the laſt day, will wring their Hands, that they have known no more of God, by the means vouchſafed them; but Chriſtians will rend their Hearts, that they have known ſo much of God to no better purpoſe: So as all Practical Treatiſes, or Treatiſes quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening unto Practice, are few enough to awaken men to their Duties. And as for thoſe that treat of Meditation (as many Worthies have done, whoſe Books I am not worthy to carry after them) yet I find none that have Collected all neceſſary Practical Truths, and Duties into ſuch a way of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, but either are too large, or too
<pb facs="tcp:152821:5"/>ſtreight; and therefore, I hope this may, through the Bleſſing of God, conduce much to the benefit of thoſe, to whom God ſhall give Hearts to make uſe of it, which is the Unfeigned Deſire, and Earneſt Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt all Religious Duties, there is none more neceſſary, profitable, and comfortable, to a Chriſtian, than Divine Meditation; and yet, no du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that Chriſtians are leſs acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, more backward to, and careleſs of, than that: I have therefore made choice of this Subject to ſpeak unto, and the more
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152821:9"/>fully, that I might thereby quicken my ſelf, and you, to the more frequent practiſe of it; and the rather, becauſe Experience ſhews it, to be the life and ſoul of Religion. Without Meditation, a Chriſtian is but the Carkaſs of a Chriſtian; it's as eaſie for a Man to live without a Heart, as a Chriſtian to live a ſpiritual life without Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And, becauſe ſome complain of ſcarcity or want of matter, others of plenty, or too much matter, and others of diſtraction, or want of Method; I ſhall endeavour therefore, to ſelect the choiſeſt things for Meditation through the body of Divinity, and reduce them to their ſeveral heads: that ſo, how-ever you cannot remember them all, yet you may have them ſtill before your Eyes, and go on in the meditation of them, day after day; or chooſe out ſuch heads, as your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Exigencies moſt call for.</p>
               <p>But firſt of all, before I enter on the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar heads of Meditation, I ſhall open to you the nature of it, and preſs upon you the practiſe of it.</p>
               <p>For the connexion of the words, take it briefly thus: The whole <hi>Pſalm</hi> is no other than a Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>David</hi>'s, on God's Attributes and Works.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Verſe, you have his Meditation on God's Attributes: In the <hi>2d.</hi> Verſe to the 26. you have his Meditation on God's Works, firſt of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then of Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> His works of Creation: and here, on the work of every day; as for Example, the firſt day God made the Light, and that you have in the ſecond Verſe; the ſecond day he made the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, Verſe the ſecond; the third day he made
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152821:9"/>the Earth, and the Water, and that you have Verſ. the 5, to the 19; the fourth day he made the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars, and this you have Verſe the 19, to the 25; the fifth day he made the Sea, and the Fiſh in it, and this you have in the <hi>25th.</hi> Verſe; the ſixth day, he made Man, and the Beaſts of the Earth, and this you have in the midſt of the reſt, Verſ. 14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Having meditated on the works of Creation; next, he proceeds to the works of his Providence, Verſ. 26. to the 31. And, from the conſideration of all theſe glorious Attributes and Works of God, breaks out into Gratulation, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Affection, and Supplication, Firſt, Gratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Verſe 31, 32, 33: Meditation and Affection, Verſe the 34: and Supplication, Verſe the laſt.</p>
               <p>That which I have made choice of to treat on, is Meditation, Verſe the 34. Whence, the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is obvious to all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That, It is the property of Saints to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on God, and the things of God.</p>
               <p>For the more profitable opening of it, we ſhall enquire into theſe things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What Meditation is.</item>
                  <item>2. The Kinds of it.</item>
                  <item>3. Prove the Point.</item>
                  <item>4. Give you the Grounds of it; and then,</item>
                  <item>5. Apply it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What Meditation is: The word in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal hath a double ſignification, it's rendered ſometimes Meditation, and ſometimes Speech. So ſome tranſlates it: but our laſt, and the moſt [Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation], and ſo I ſhall handle it. This duty is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152821:10"/>ways expreſſed in the Scripture, as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Sometimes, Remembring, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>When I remember thee on my Bed,</hi> explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the following words, <hi>and meditate on thee in the Night—Watches: Secondly,</hi> Sometimes it's call'd A thinking on God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.9. <hi>We have Thought upon thy loving kindneſs, O God.</hi> Sometimes A muſing on God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>I muſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the work of thine hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. But what is it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In the general, no other than, The fixing of our thoughts upon a thing; or, A ſerious muſing on it, that we may the better underſtand it, and be more affected with it. So as there are two ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Acts in it; <hi>First,</hi> One direct upon the thing meditated on; and the <hi>Second</hi> reflect, upon the Perſon meditating. The firſt is an act of the mind, or the contemplative part of the underſtanding; the ſecond is an act of the conſcience applying the thing unto a man's ſelf. The end of the firſt is to enlighten, of the ſecond to better the ſoul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the kinds: It is either deliberate, and ſolemn, or occaſional and ſudden. <hi>First,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate, and Solemn, is, when we ſolemnly ſet apart ſome time, and ſequeſter our ſelves from all company, to think upon ſome ſpiritual matter for the better informing of our judgments, warming of our affections, and reforming our lives, as that of <hi>David</hi> in the 119 <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Occaſional and ſudden, is that which is occaſioned by ſuch outward objects, as by the providence of God are offer'd unto our ſenſes, as that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>When I conſider, &amp;c. Firſt,</hi> of deliberate and ſolemn Meditation, I ſhall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152821:10"/>open it a little further to you, and therein ſhew you a little more clearly, What this is, and That this is the property of the Saints, The grounds of it, and then Apply it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It may be deſcribed thus; A ſerious fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our thoughts upon ſome thing, with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular application of it to our ſelves, ſo as to be affected with it, and frame our lives according to it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> (I ſay) it is a ſerious fixing of our thoughts upon a thing; not a ſlight and tranſient thought, but a fixed and dwel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing thought, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>My meditation ſhall be of thee all the day, Verſ</hi> 97. <hi>Secondly,</hi> with particular application of into our ſelves, like the good Houſwife, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 31. &amp; 16. <hi>She conſidereth a Field, and buyeth it;</hi> ſo gracious Souls conſider of this, and that, ſpiritual ſubject and appropriate it; that is, lay it to their heart, as it is expreſſed, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 57.1. <hi>The righteous are taken away from the evil to come, and no man lays it to heart:</hi> And <hi>Malachy</hi> 2.2. <hi>If you will not lay it to heart, &amp;c. Thirdly,</hi> ſo as to be affected with it: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.3. <hi>Whilſt I was muſing, the fire burned: Pſal.</hi> 119 50. <hi>This is my comfort in mine affliction: thy word hath quickned me:</hi> And <hi>Verſ.</hi> 52. <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred thy judgments of old, and have comforted my ſelf. Fourthly</hi> to frame our lives according to it, as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119 59. <hi>I conſider'd my ways, and turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies:</hi> And that <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe without practiſe, all knowledge is but ignorance, 1 <hi>Epſt. John</hi> 2.4. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> it will aggravate mens condemnation at the laſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.48.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this is the property of gracious Souls, you may ſee in <hi>David</hi> here, and frequently
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152821:11"/>elſe-where, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.6. &amp; 143. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.15.23.48.78.97.99.148. Then, <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 24.63. And all other godly men, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 1. verſ. <hi>2d. Malach.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For the grounds of it; <hi>First,</hi> becauſe they know it is their duty, that which God hath commanded, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 1.8. 1 <hi>Timothy.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Coloſſians</hi> 3.2. <hi>Set your affections on things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their love to God: Love delights to think on the Perſon and Thing beloved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97. <hi>Oh, how I love thy Law, it is my meditation all the day long. Amor eſt ubi amat, non ubi animat,</hi> is an old ſaying, and as true as old, The mind is where a man loves, and not where he lives. The more men love, the more they think; and the more they think, the more they love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The tranſcendent excellency of God, and the things of God, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 119.129. <hi>Thy teſtimonies are wonderful, therefore doth my ſoul keep them.</hi> Canticles 1.3. <hi>Thy Name is an Ointment poured out, therefore do the Virgins love thee,</hi> Pſalm. 3.2, 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Becauſe they have receiv'd a new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: They are made partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. They are renewed in the ſpirit of their minds, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. and thereby are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from theſe things below, to mind, affect, and purſue thoſe things above. Men of high, and noble ſpirits can't endure to be imployed about low, and baſe things, but thoſe of the higheſt and greateſt Concernment; ſo, Gracious Souls they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the things of the World, and the Fleſh too low for them, and deſire to have their thoughts to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152821:11"/>be taken up with God, and Chriſt, his Spirit and Kingdom, their precious and immortal Souls; their ſafety and welfare here, and to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>Such as the man is, ſuch are his thoughts; <hi>The liberal man deviſeth liberal things,</hi> Iſaiah 32.8. <hi>A good man out of the good treaſury of his heart bringeth forth good things,</hi> Math. 12.35.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. This ſhews us the reaſon why Profeſſors are ſuch Non-proficients in the School of Chriſt; namely, becauſe they are ſo ſeldom and ſlight in this weighty duty of Meditation, reſt in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reading, and never think on it more: the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will never trouble ſuch; he cares not how much they are in duty, ſo he can prevail with them not to think on it after.</p>

                  <p>For the humiliation of three ſorts. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Such as meditate not at all on God, or the things of God, as natural, carnal, wordly Men do not, will not; <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 10.4 <hi>The ungodly is ſo proud, God is not in all his thoughts, Viz.</hi> with any delight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Such as have their Meditation on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, as the ambitious Man on his honour, the Covetous Man on his wealth, the Voluptuous Man on his pleaſure, the Merchant on his Ships, the Trades-man on his Shop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> none of them any ſerious thoughts of God, or the things of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A worſe ſort there are that think on
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152821:12"/>God, not to honour him, but diſhonour him; either have low and baſe thoughts of him, or wicked and ungodly thoughts; <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some that have low and baſe thoughts of God, as ignorant and ſuperſtitious ſorts of People, who conceive of God, as an old Man, ſitting in Heaven with a Crown on his Head, and a Scepter in his Hand, looking down upon his Creatures, and governing the World; others, Though they do not conceive of him ſo groſly, with a Bodily ſubſtance, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be a Spirit, yet not ſuch a Spirit as he hath revealed himſelf to be, a Pure, Holy, Juſt, Omnipreſent, Omniſcient, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Spirit; but conceive him to be ſuch a one as themſelves, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Others, they have wicked and ungodly thoughts of him; ſome, Atheiſtical thoughts, as thoſe, in <hi>Job</hi> 21. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>Who is the Almighty, that we ſhould ſerve him?</hi> Others, baſphemous thoughts, as they, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 94. <hi>Tuſh!

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152821:12"/>remove the Hinderances of it; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Give you ſome Helps to it; And, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Some Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The Neceſſity of it, in many reſpects; as, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The command of God, that which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly requires, as you ſaw before, and may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Job</hi> 37.14. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.15. <hi>Haggai.</hi> 1.5, 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe it is the end, wherefore he hath revealed, and made himſelf known to us, in his Word and Works, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.4. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 41.19 20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe without Meditation no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, <hi>David</hi> firſt conſider'd hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

That there is no Converſion without Meditation, appears, in that ſuch as are connected, are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this way, and Method; <hi>First,</hi> They he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r the Word; <hi>Secondly</hi> are convinc'd of the Truth <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Meditates how much it concerns them; <hi>Fourthly,</hi> by Meditation come to be affected with it; And, <hi>Fifthly,</hi> By affection, are wrought over to a holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of Faith and Obedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Becauſe, without Meditation, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not profit by any thing you hear, or read, out of the Word, or ſee in the works of God. A Plant may as ſoon grow without watering, and Meat nouriſh without digeſting, as a Soul profit in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs without Meditation: God provides Meat, ſends his Miniſters to Cook it, and dreſs it; it is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152821:13"/>Meditation muſt Concoct it; otherwiſe like Meat undigeſted, the Stomack will be burdened with it, and caſt it up again; or, if it abide, it will breed ill humours, and make them ſick unto death. The Reaſons are obvious; <hi>First,</hi> Becauſe, without me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, the Seed of the Word will lye uncover'd in the Furrows of the Soul; and being uncover'd, the Devil will come and ſteal it away, as the Birds do the Seed in the High-way, that lieth uncover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe, without meditation, we ſhall never be affected with what we hear, or read out of the Word, <hi>Deutr.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Theſe words which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thy heart;</hi> and it cannot be in the heart, if we do not meditate on it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Without meditation, it will not ſtay, or abide on the heart: it is meditation that keeps it, and faſtens it, and makes it like letters, Engraven on Gold and Marble, to abide long; <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Becauſe, Not to meditate on the Word, is to offer contempt to the Word, as a Man doth to that Perſon, and thing, which he never regards to mind, and think on; and, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13 13. <hi>He that deſpiſeth the Word, ſhall be deſtroyed: Fifthly,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, without meditation, when Men come to lie on their ſick and Death-beds, their Eyes will be opened, to ſee and bewail their folly; for a Man to walk in a way, and never conſider where he is going, and what miſchief may befall him in it, How will he befool himſelf? How will he wiſh he had hearkned to God's counſels? <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. Oh, that men were wiſe, underſtood this, conſider their latter end.

                  <p n="1">1. It is an Angelical ſervice; the only and the chief Service (that we know of) that the Angels are exerciſed in, <hi>ſc.</hi> the meditation of God's glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious excellencies, will, and ways, and works; and therefore, if we would attain to the Height of Angels, it muſt be by Meditation: Dr. <hi>Holdſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.48.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2dly.</hi> A ſecond motive is the tranſcendent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of this duty: <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is a duty moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and acceptable unto God, above all other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; above all Ear-ſervice, Tongue-ſervice, and Hand-ſervice; if there be not Head and Heart-ſervice, he abhors all, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 29.13. But now me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, that makes all acceptable, whatſoever defects and failings there be in the reſt; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe meditation comes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the heart, which is that God prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally looks to, and delights in: <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe the ſecreſie of it is accompanied with more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and ſincerity, which are the graces God ſo much prizeth. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe it is a duty or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily more full of ſpiritualneſs and heavenli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than other duties are. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of it, appears, in that nothing is able to hinder us from it no Time, nor Tyrant, though they may from ſpeaking, and acting, yet not from meditating and thinking on God, and the things of God; the mind of the greateſt Slave is ſtill free to think on what he will: <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is that which will transform us more into the <hi>Image of God, from glory to glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. <hi>ult.</hi> As a Pearl, by the frequent beating of the Sun-beams upon it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more lightſome, and radiant, like the Sun; ſo Meditation, not only makes the faces of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152821:14"/>to ſhine, but their lives in the Eys of all, God, Angels, and Men; good, and bad: <hi>Sixthly,</hi> In that it is an Anticipation of glory, a perſpective to ſhew us the glory of Heaven, <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Ladder to carry us up to Heaven, a taking poſſeſſion of Heaven in our minds, before we come there in our bodies; by this, we may, with <hi>Stephen,</hi> ſee Chriſt ſtanding at the right hand of God, ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, and with <hi>Moſes</hi> talk with God face to face, and with the Apoſtle be rapt up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſee that happineſs we are loath to leave, and cannot utter what it is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Motive is the great Utility of this duty, no duty more profitable for Humiliation, Conſolation, Edification, and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> For Humiliation: Meditation makes men look into, and ſeriouſly conſider the lives of their ways, the multitude and greatneſs of their ſins, the Circumſtances that do aggravate them, the ſad fruits, and effects of them, and ſo humble themſelves the more thorowly under them: As <hi>Peter,</hi> after he had denied his Lord and Maſter, when he reflected, and conſider'd, whom he had denied, and who he was that denied him, and how often he had denied him, it made him go out, and weep bitterly; whereas on the contrary, if men never ſet apart any time to meditate of the ſinfulneſs of their nature, the evil of their ways, and the circumſtances by which they are aggravated, they can never be humbled under them, as they ought, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 8 6. <hi>No man repents of his wickedneſs;</hi> Why? becauſe no man ſaid, <hi>What have I done?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Moſt profitable for Conſolation; <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:152821:14"/>Becauſe it makes men to look after the Remedy, the grace of God hath vouchſafed to free them from ſin, and miſery, and labour to know Jeſus Chriſt, who he is, and what he hath done, and ſuffer'd for them, and what they muſt do to get an intereſt in his Merits, Graces, Benefits; <hi>Secondly,</hi> It makes them to acquaint themſelves with the Covenant of Grace, which he hath made and ſeal'd in the blood of his Son, to get an intereſt in it, and thoſe many and precious promiſes of pardon and peace, ſalvation and deliverance; all, Yea, and Amen, in Chriſt Jeſus; as you may ſee in <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 94.19. Whereas, without medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, men are careleſs of theſe things, and ſo deprive themſelves of that ſupport and comfort, which otherwiſe they might have in time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That which will clear up a work of grace, evidence them to be truly gracious Souls, according to that of the wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.7. <hi>As he thinketh in his heart, ſo is he.</hi> As a Man's thoughts are, ſuch is the man. Meditation (as one well ſaith) is the Touch-ſtone of a Chriſtian, it ſhews what Metal he is made of; it's a ſpiritual Index, to ſhew what is within, as the Index ſhews what is in the Book, ſo Meditation ſhews what is in the heart. The godly Man thinks on God's Name, <hi>Malachi</hi> 3.17. but for the wicked man, God is not in all his thoughts, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Profitable for Edification, and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the whole man in grace and gracious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes: it betters the Head, the Heart, the Tongue, the Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It betters the Head, keeps out evil thoughts, and furniſheth them with good thoughts; it makes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152821:15"/>men look into the nature of things, to ſearch the Scriptures, whether things be ſo, or no; to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their own ways, whether they be good, or evil, and ſo to make the greater progreſs in ways of well-doing, as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.99. whereas, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Meditation, all that men read, and hear, is but —<hi>rudis indigeſtaque moles,</hi> a kind of confuſed know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. As it betters the Underſtanding, ſo the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; for it recalls things forgotten, and imprints them the more deeply in the memory, rivets them there, and turns them into blood and ſpirit, juice and marrow: whereas the neglect of it ſpoils the memory, and makes them loſe the benefit of all they have heard, and read, and ſeen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It betters the Heart, for it makes men apply general truths to themſelves in particular, turns Brain-knowledge into Heart—knowledge, Contemplative-knowledge into Practical—know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And needs muſt it better the Heart, ſeeing it excites and ſtirs-up the Affections to love and delight more in what they hear, and read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.3. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 119.97. It quickens alſo to duty, and fits men for it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.1. It ſets the heart alſo in Tune; the Muſician firſt puts his Inſtrument in Tune, and then plays his Leſſon: ſo Meditation, it tunes the Heart, and then enables to holy duty: in a word, it's the Wing of the Soul, by which it mounts up to Heaven, and takes a view of the Coeleſtial <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It betters the Tongue, it furniſheth a Man with matter, and Method, to ſpeak unto God's glory, and other's edification, whether at home, or abroad; in trading or travelling, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he is about: whereas without meditation,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152821:15"/>a Scholar is no more, than what he reads out of his Book, and a Hearer no more than what he hears out of the Pulpit. Hearing brings truth to the Ear, but Meditation brings it into the Heart: The Bee firſt ſucks the flower, and then by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Hive, makes Honey of it; ſo muſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, after hearing, work it on their hearts; or no Honey of Grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It betters the Life, in that it cauſeth the Word to have power on the heart, to perſwade, and draw Men to the practiſe of it. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5, 6. Whereas without meditation, it hath no influence upon the heart, as you may ſee generally in thoſe that neglect it; And it ſtands with reaſon, becauſe Meat (though never ſo well dreſſed) doth not nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh us, is a burden, rather than a benefit, being not digeſted; ſo is it with the food of the Soul, as we finde in thoſe, by ſad experience, that cannot endure to have it brought home to their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It's profitable unto Salvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. Then are ye ſaved, if you keep in memory what I have preached unto you, that is, ſo as to meditate on it: And <hi>Pſalm</hi> firſt, <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that delights in the Law of God, and meditates therein Day and Night:</hi> Bleſſed with Grace here, and Glory hereafter.</p>
                  <p>A fourth Motive, drawn from the ſweetneſs of it. It muſt needs be very ſweet; <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe, if it be delightful to wicked men, to think on evil, then much more for godly Men to think on that which is good, and the chief Good: <hi>Secondly,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, it not only carries up the Soul to Heaven, but brings down Heaven into the Soul: It is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152821:16"/>of the beatifical Viſion, a handſel of Heavens happineſs, a fore-taſt of Eternal Life. This is it made <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>The meditation of him was ſweet,</hi> and to account it <hi>ſweeter than the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or the Honey-comb, Pſalm.</hi> 19. and to eſteem it above Thouſands of Silver and Gold. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. Thus you ſee enough by way of Motive. That which I ſhall do next, will be, To remove the Letts that hinder Men from this duty; Becauſe there is not one Duty that meets with more rubs and hinderances, both from within and without, than this of Meditation, eſpecially from Satan, who ſets himſelf moſt againſt this, That men may not reflect upon their ways, and thereby be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to get out of his ſnare; It ſhould be our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome therefore to break the Cords of this Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Philiſtim; The benefit and comfort of it will make amends for all.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But what are theſe Lets and hinderances?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> They are either vain pretences, or ſinful luſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Vain pretences; as for inſtance, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some, and the moſt pretend the difficulty of it, that it's a very hard matter, to ſequeſter a man's ſelf, and keep the heart cloſe to God, in ſpiritual things. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It's true, it is ſo; but conſider, So are all excellent things, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, But this ſhould be no diſcouragement, but rather an encouragement to labour the more after them; It's a hard work for Men to Plow, and Sowe, and Reap; to digg in Mines for Gold and Silver; to make long Voyages through many Storms: yet all this men are willing to do, for gains-ſake. How much more ſhould we undertake this work of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:152821:16"/>ſeeming, though never ſo hard and harſh in regard of the practice, yet it is ſweet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the profit. This, as you have ſeen, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters head, heart, tongue, life. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and harſhneſs of it, is only at the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance upon it, uſe and exerciſe will make it facil and eaſie; Chriſt's Yoke, at the firſt putting on, ſeems heavy, but when it is once on, and worn a while, it becomes eaſie, and will prove a Crown at laſt; It's hard to get up to the top of a high Mountain, but when a Man is up, he findes a very pleaſant, and delightful proſpect, that abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recompenceth all his labour, and pain; ſo will this duty of meditation, it will cauſe us to come down from the Mount, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> with our faces ſhining, and our lives alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Others pretend their weakneſs, and inability for this duty, in regard of the blindneſs of their minds, dulneſs of their head, deadneſs of their ſpirits; whereas theſe ſhould quicken them, ſo much the rather to make uſe of it, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſpecial means to remove them. Men do not uſe to abſtain from food, or Phyſick, becauſe they are weak, but rather make uſe of them, that they may get better ſtomacks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Others pretend want of matter: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this is a vain excuſe, it is not ſo much want of matter, as want of a heart, for a Man cannot look any where, above or beneath, within or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, or round about, but he may finde matter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to imploy his head, and heart: the Book of the Creatures, the Book of the Scriptures, of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, of Conſcience, are full of profitable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the conſideration of our own ſins, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152821:17"/>wants and neceſſities, God's continued and renewed Mercies, and Judgments, will afford a Man matter enough every Day to meditate on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Others pretend want of leaſure, they have ſo much buſineſs, as they cannot attend it, a vain excuſe, for they can find leiſure enough to meditate on vain and ſinful things, for vain and fooliſh talk, and vain and fooliſh paſs-times, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their worldly occaſions. And whatſoever elſe men neglect, they ought to have an eye to, and a care of the welfare of their Souls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other things, this being the one thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in compariſon whereof all other things are unneceſſary; as men are made to acknowledg, when they come to lie on their Death-beds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Others pretend they want a convenient place, and time; A vain excuſe too; for however a man may not have ſo convenient a place for ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and ſolitarineſs, as he would, yet there is none that hath a heart to the duty, but he may finde ſome place, or other to do it in. If not in the houſe with <hi>Daniel,</hi> 6.10. yet in the Field with <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 24. And if he be hinder'd in the Day time, yet he may do it in the Night with <hi>David, Pſalm.</hi> 6. and <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16. and <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Other hinderances are the ſinful luſts of the fleſh; <hi>Firſt,</hi> all ſin in general, it ſo dims and dazles the eye of the mind, as it can no more behold ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Excellencies, than the Owl can the light of the Sun; <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some ſins in ſpecial keep men from it; as, <hi>First,</hi> Thoſe ſins we are moſt inclin'd unto by our conſtitution, and complexion, theſe uſually inſinuate themſelves moſt, and Satan uſeth
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:152821:17"/>moſt to tempt unto, either to hinder us from, or diſtract us in duty; <hi>Secondly,</hi> giving way to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, and roaving Senſes, vain and wicked thoughts, theſe keep out better: whence that, <hi>Jeremy</hi> 14.4. <hi>Oh Jeruſalem, waſh thine heart from filthineſs, how long ſhall vain thoughts lodge within thee!</hi> The Veſſel muſt firſt be cleanſed of the filth in it, before it can be capable of ſweet and precious Liquor, eſpecially the giving way to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, covetous, voluptuous thoughts, or inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate affection to the honours, riches, pleaſures of the World, this you may find our Saviour ſhews to be that which keeps men from duty, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts men in it, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.22. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.19. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.14. Theſe worldly and fleſhly thoughts and affections, they are as Bird-lime to the Wings of the Bird; ſo intangle the Soul, as it cannot ſoar aloft on the Wing of Meditation: they are as Leaden-weights or Plummets tied at the Leggs, to keep men from aſcending the Mount of the Lord, and therefore to hearken to the counſel of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. and as to keep out all ſinful, and worldly thoughts, ſo all religious thoughts, when they are unſeaſonable, or impertinent to the preſent buſineſs in hand, ſeeing however for the matter they be good, yet they are cunningly thruſt in by Satan to diſtract us in our preſent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, that ſo by thinking on two things at once, we ſhould not receive benefit by either, therefore to watch againſt them, and keep our hearts cloſe to the ſubject we have made choice of to meditate on. Thus for the Letts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Follow the Helps to meditations; and the <hi>Firſt</hi> may be this, To chooſe out ſome ſpecial
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:152821:18"/>ſubject to meditate on, either concerning God, or our ſelves, and not run from one to another: <hi>Secondly,</hi> Set about it with affection to it, for what we affect, that we delight to think on; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Get an inward principle of grace, that may ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate your ſpirits, and mount your minds upward, heavy things they naturally deſcend, becauſe they have a principle inclining to it: light things aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, becauſe they have a principle inclining to it. And therefore (I ſay) get ſuch an inward principle of grace, that may call us upward; look as 'tis with a worldly-minded man, wherſoever he is, or whatſoever he is doing, ſtill the World is in his thoughts; when he riſeth up, and when he lieth down, yea, and when he ſleeps, he dreams of the World; nay, in his beſt ſervices, hearing, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, faſting, praying, ſtill his heart is on his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, pleaſures; ſo it is with a godly man, that hath received a Principle of grace; whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he is, and whatſoever he is doing, his heart is ſtill God-ward, and Grace-ward, and Heaven-ward. As ſoon as he is awak'd, he is preſently with God, and walks all the day after with God, as <hi>Noah, Geneſ.</hi> 11.6. and at Night he endeavours to ſleep with God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 4. [laſt]. His whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is in Heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20.</p>
                  <p>A fourth help is temperance in the uſe of the Creature: this clears the head from Vapours, the Body from humours, that would diſtemper it, and unfit it for duty, and renders the Body every way ſerviceable to the Soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To keep a narrow watch over our Thoughts within, and our Senſes without, that they do not with-draw our hearts from what we are to meditate on.</p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:152821:18"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Pray unto God ſo to fit us for it, aſſiſt us in it, and bleſs it to us, as it may be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to him, and profitable and comfortable to us: So much for the Helps.</p>
                  <p>The fourth thing I promiſed, was the Rules, and directions to be obſerv'd in, and about it; and theſe reſpect the Perſon, the Geſture, the Place, the time, and the manner; <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the Perſons that would meditate with profit and comfort, they muſt be thus qualified, Holy, humble, chaſt, and meek; <hi>Firſt,</hi> Holy, becauſe unholy ones, neither will nor can meditate on holy things with any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or delight; <hi>Secondly,</hi> Humble, becauſe God reſiſts the proud, and gives Grace only to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>James</hi> 4. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Chaſt, becauſe ſuch as are laden with luſt, are ever learning, <hi>and never come to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> 2 Tim 3.7. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Meek, becauſe paſſion blindes the mind, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers the whole man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Geſture to be uſed in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, no certain rules can be given, but every one to uſe that which he findes by experience to be moſt helpful to him in duty: only in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that it be Reverential, and ſuch as may moſt ſtir up Devotion, and keep us moſt attentive to, and intentive on the duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For the Place of meditation, we may meditate with <hi>Iſaac</hi> in the Field, <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Chamber, <hi>David</hi> in the Bed, <hi>Peter</hi> on the Houſe top, <hi>Christ</hi> in the Mount: it is not much materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al where it be, ſo we obſerve the counſel, (a great Maſter in this Art gives) which is to have an eye to three things, Secreſie, Silence, and Reſt; The <hi>first</hi> excludes company, the <hi>ſecond</hi> noiſe, the <hi>third</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:152821:19"/>motion, all very uſeful to prevent diſtraction, which we are very ſubject to in this duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> For the time of ſolemn meditation, we ſhould make Conſcience of it, before, in, or at every Duty of God's Worſhip; we ſhould do well to ſet apart ſome time every Day. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.3. A godly man is ſaid to be a man ſet apart: as God ſets him apart for himſelf by Election, ſo he ſhould ſet himſelf apart for God, by Meditation; and when you do, to take the beſt and fitteſt ſeaſon (for every thing is beautiful in its ſeaſon): now the ſeaſons for performing this duty, are either ordinary, or extraordinary; <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſeaſons, they are either the Week-day, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> For extraordinary Seaſons, they are amongſt others, theſe; <hi>First,</hi> When the ſpirit of God doth in a more than ordinary manner move and incline to it, when the Spirit lifts up the heart to Heaven, then to lift up with him, to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and cheriſh thoſe motions; <hi>Secondly,</hi> When you are under more than ordinary trouble of Spirit, then to apply your ſelves to this duty, for Cordials are never more ſeaſonable than in times of fainting, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2 <hi>laſt verſes: Thirdly,</hi> When either Age or ſickneſs do ſummon us to death, then is a fit ſeaſon to meditate on God, and the things of God, when all other things in the World begin to leave us, then to think on thoſe things will never leave us, for it's obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Saints, they have been moſt heavenly in their mediations, affections, and expreſſions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their end, as <hi>Jacob, Geneſ.</hi> laſt; <hi>Moſes,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:152821:20"/>Deut.</hi> 33. &amp; 33. <hi>chap.</hi> our Saviour in the 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> we ſhould follow them in the ſame practiſe. As the pulling down of one Ballance, is the lifting up of another; ſo the drawing down of the body to Earth, ſhould be the lifting up of the Soul to Heaven: As the Soul here is uſually at the worſt, when the Body is at the beſt; ſo the Soul ſhould be at the beſt, when the Body is at the worſt.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Circumſtance, is the Manner how we are to perform this duty, and that is thus, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially, reverently, ſeriouſly, affectionately, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and orderly: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Cordially, becauſe it's not the meditation of the head, but the heart God looks unto: <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. <hi>My Son give me thy heart. Luke</hi> 2.19. <hi>Mary</hi> ponder'd Chriſt's ſayings in her heart, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 19. laſt, and 49.3. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To do it reverently, remembering and conſidering he is a great King, and his Name is dreadful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Heathen, <hi>Malachy</hi> 1. <hi>ult.;</hi> therefore to take heed of any unreverent, or careleſs beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in his preſence and worſhip, as being a great diſhonour to him, and that which he ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves in thoſe formal and lazie Prieſts, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. [about the end]; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Seriouſly, ſo as to keep the mind intent upon the buſineſs in hand, and not to give way to any other thoughts, though they be good thoughts, becauſe they are unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable at that time, and will thruſt out the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo make both uſeleſs: to keep alſo a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row watch over our hearts, and ſenſes, that they be not avocated, or drawn aſide by other objects. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Affectionately, ſo as to have our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſtirred, and warmed, and wrought upon by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:152821:20"/>thoſe things we meditate on, as <hi>David</hi> here in the Text, [My Meditation of him ſhall be ſweet, and I will be glad in the Lord]; ſo to think on ſpiritual, and heavenly things, as they may leave an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon the Soul, as the Seal doth on the Wax, that ſo your affections may anſwer your cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the Wax doth the Seal, and the Eccho the voice; As for Example, when you think on the glorious Majeſty of God, to make your hearts ſtand in aw of Him; when on his Love, Grace, Mercy, to have your Hearts thereby indear'd to him: <hi>Secondly,</hi> When on Chriſt, the amiableneſs, and fulneſs that is in him, and in him for you; to have your deſires drawn out the more, after near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſweeter, fuller communion with him: when on the Holy Ghoſt, his ſweet motions, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to have your Hearts opened to receive Him, and obey Him in them: <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When on the Word, to do it with a particular Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Fifthly,</hi> When on God's Works of Mercy, and Juſtice, to have your Hearts melt with the one, and tremble at the other: <hi>Sixthly,</hi> When on your ſelves, your ſins and corruptions, to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled under them; when on the Evidences of God's love and grace, to rejoice in them: <hi>Seventhly,</hi> When on the World, and the things of it, to have your hearts diſingag'd from them, and hang looſe to them; <hi>Laſtly,</hi> When on Death, to live in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual expectation, and a religious preparation for it: when on the Judgment-Day to caſt up your accounts, &amp; ſit in judgment on your ſelves, that you may not be condemn'd with the World: ſo think on Hell, as your Hearts may tremble at ſin that made it; and ſo think on Heaven, that your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:152821:21"/>may be there, where you hope e're long to have your Habitation to all Eternity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To do it conſtantly, ſo as to obſerve the due, and the appointed time, or otherwiſe omiſſion and intermiſſion may ſoon cauſe amiſſion, and ſo dead the affection, as to become weary of it, and caſt off the duty, and therefore to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in it, and continue ſo long in it, until our hearts be affected with what we think, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome benefit by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> To do it orderly, for God being a God of Order, he loves Order in us: to this end to have an eye to three things, the Ingreſs, the Progreſs, and the Egreſs: As for Example, to begin with Hearing, or Reading, and then go on with Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or thinking on it, and then end all with Prayer: for (as Mr. <hi>Greenham</hi> well ſaid) Hearing, and reading, without Meditation, is uſeleſs: Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation without reading, and hearing fruitleſs, and both without prayer will be ſucceſsleſs (miſs a bleſſing). More diſtinctly and fully: <hi>Firſt,</hi> for the Ingreſs, or Entrance upon it, we are to prepare for it, by making choice of ſome particular ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, moſt ſutable to your preſent condition, and then lift up an Ejaculation for the Lord directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, aſſiſtance, and bleſſing on it; <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Progreſs in it, to obſerve a Method in it, either ſuch as Scholars uſe to do in Meditation on a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; as, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Definition, or Deſcription; <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Diviſion, or kind, or parts; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Cauſes efficient, material, formal, final; <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The fruits, and the effects, and the like Logical heads, all which you may ſee exemplified in Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi>'s, and Mr. <hi>Roger</hi>'s Seven Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:152821:21"/>or thus (which I conceive a more profitable way, for our more ordinary ſort of hearers, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not acquainted with this art) to proceed in your Meditations, as you are taught; <hi>First,</hi> On the Doctrine, then the Proofs, then the Reaſons, then the Uſes, and in them the ſigns, motives, means. You that have this Book (becauſe your Memory is weak) to take it in your hands, and begin with the firſt Head of Meditation, and then go on, Day after Day, until you have gone tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and if there be any ſpecial ſubject, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to meditate on, to look into the Contents: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For the Egreſs, or Concluſion of your Meditation; <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſo reflect and look back, how we have perform'd it: If not with profit, and comfort, then to take notice wherein we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, and faulty, and humble our ſelves under it, and mend it the next time: If we have reaped benefit and comfort by it, to bleſs God for it, and conclude all with praiſe, for his gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with us, and pray he would make all effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al for the bettering of our heads, and hearts, and tongues, and lives. And thus of Meditation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Next, becauſe moſt complain of ſcarcity, or want of matter; others of diſtraction, through want of Method, I have therefore thought fit to ſelect the choiſeſt things for Meditation (through the Body of Divinity) and reduce them to their ſeveral Heads, that ſo however you cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them all, yet you may have them ſtill before your eye, and go on in the Meditation of them, Day after Day.</p>

               <p>AND firſt, I ſhall begin with ſolemn and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate Meditation; and after give you ſome heads for ſudden and occaſional Meditation.</p>
               <p>For ſolemn and deliberate Meditation, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your Meditation may be reduced to theſe 6, or 7 Heads, God, and Chriſt, the Holy Spirit, Man, the World, and the good and evil Angels, by which God governs the World; <hi>First,</hi> I ſhall ſhew you what ſpecial things you are to meditate on in GOD, to begin with him, who is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all things, and to be often, and much in meditation on him, for the more we meditate on him, the more we ſhall know him, and the more we know him, the more we ſhall love him, and the more we love him, the more we ſhall deſire him, and the more we deſire him, the more ſhall we labour after communion with him, not only in grace here, but in glory hereafter: but here, in meditating on God, take with you theſe three Cautions: <hi>First,</hi> To meditate on him in a way of faith, and not reaſon; becauſe reaſon cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Unity in Trinity, or Trinity in Unity. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Not to conceive of God out of Chriſt, becauſe God out of Chriſt is a conſuming Fire, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. <hi>laſt. Thirdly,</hi> Take heed of framing any Image of God in your minds, he being a Spirit, and an Infinite Spirit, in all, and through all, and above all; but to conceive of him (I ſay) in Chriſt (who is the expreſs Image of the Father) the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by which we are to clime up to Heaven, to ſee, and know God. One well expreſſeth it thus; when
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:152821:22"/>I ſee the body of a living man, I know his Soul is there alſo, and therefore when I ſpeak to his body, I ſpeak to his underſtanding alſo, becauſe they are together; ſo in viewing with the eye of my mind the humane nature of Chriſt, glorious in Heaven, I do at the ſame time look upon the God-head, that being perſonally united unto it, for in him dwelleth the God-head bodily, (or Perſonally.)</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are thoſe things we are to meditate on, in GOD?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> His Nature, Attributes, Word, Works, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Nature, and here take notice what he is in his Beeing, and that he only is <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. What he is in his Beeing: This cannot be conceived, much leſs defined by finite Creatures, yet may be deſcribed ſo far, as he hath revealed himſelf in the Scripture, which is this, An Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Infinite, Perfect, Incomprehenſible Spirit, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed into three Perſons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, every one Co-eſſential, and Co-equal; To open this briefly; mind well, I ſay, he is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>John</hi> 4.24. Now what a Spirit is, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our tells you, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.31. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.18. <hi>ſc.</hi> a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or Beeing that cannot be ſeen, or felt: 2. I ſay he is an Eternal, Infinite, Perfect, Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible Spirit: theſe Attributes diſtinguiſh him from all other Spirits, as Angels, and the Souls of men; 1. He is an Eternal Spirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> One that had no beginning, nor can have any end, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. To the King Eternal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.8. But now Angels, and the Souls of men, though they ſhall have no end, yet had a beginning, were Created by God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1. 2. God, he is an
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:152821:23"/>Infinite Spirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> Such a Beeing, as cannot be contained within any place, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.27. Behold <hi>The Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him,</hi> and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.1. But for Angels, and the Souls of men, they are contained within their proper places; 3. God, he is a perfect Spirit, unto whom no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of goodneſs, or excellency can be added, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.5. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. I am God All-ſufficient. But for Angels, and the Souls of men, they are capable of more degrees of goodneſs and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. 4. God is an incomprehenſible Spirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.3. His greatneſs is incomprehenſible, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 1.16. He dwells in light unapproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, we may more eaſily comprehend what God is not, than what he is: but now, for Angels and the Souls of Men, we may in ſome meaſure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what they are, ſo far forth as God hath revealed it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I add [diſtinguiſhed into three Perſons]. Here to take notice: 1. What a Perſon is, <hi>ſc.</hi> a diſtinct Subſiſtence, or beeing, having in it, the whole God-head, and diſtinguiſhed from another, by his incommunicable properties, as 1. Of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to beget, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7. the Son to be begotten, <hi>John</hi> 18. and of the Holy Ghoſt to proceed from both, <hi>John</hi> 15.26. 2. To take notice, why we ſay Diſtinguiſhed, and not divided, <hi>ſc.</hi> becauſe the God-head, being one pure, ſimple, unchangeable Beeing, it cannot be divided, or ſeparated one from the other, but are in one the other, as you may ſee cleerly, <hi>John</hi> 14.9. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I add Co-eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential and Co-equal, <hi>i. e.</hi> Every one true and very God, and not one before the other, or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the other, being every one God, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:152821:23"/>in that the ſame names of God, and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of God, and actions of God are given to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Perſon in the Trinity: The Father God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 13. <hi>John</hi> 17.3. The Son God, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.8. The Holy Ghoſt God, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3, 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. To take notice and meditate ſeriouſly on theſe things in the Nature of God, becauſe the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and want of the ſerious conſideration of it, is the cauſe of ſo many miſapprehenſions of God, and aberrations from God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That you may the better know what God is, to take notice that he only is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Pſal. 83.18. <hi>Thy Name only is Jehovah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the meaning of that?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This word <hi>Jehovah,</hi> it imports three things: 1. That he hath his Beeing, in, and of, and from Himſelf, being deemed <hi>Hava,</hi> or <hi>Hajah</hi> that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth To be, and be of himſelf and from himſelf. 2. It is he that gave a beeing to all that have any beeing, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.24. <hi>I am Jehovah that made all things:</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>laſt,</hi> Of him, and through him, and for him are all things, and <hi>Acts</hi> 17.28. 3. That it is he alſo that doth, and will give a bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all his words, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.15. This is his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial to all Ages, <hi>i. e.</hi> of his truth and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all Ages. <hi>Exod.</hi> 6 3. Where he ſaith to <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he appeared to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> by the Name of All-mighty; but, by the Name of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> I was not known to them, <hi>i. e.</hi> in making good his promiſe of delivering them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and bringing them into <hi>Canaan.</hi> Now that which you are here ſeriouſly to meditate on, is this, the wonderful and condeſcending grace of God to us his poor worthleſs Creatures,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:152821:24"/>he being <hi>Jehovah,</hi> having his beeing, in, and of and from himſelf, might for ever have delighted himſelf in himſelf, but being goodneſs it ſelf would communicate it, in giving a beeing to thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> glorious Fabrick of Heaven and Earth, and all that have any beeing in it; the ſerious meditation of this, muſt needs affect our hearts, with love to him, and delight in him, that he who had no need of us, ſhould give a beeing to us, that he who is ſo high, and holy above us, ſhould humble himſelf to have reſpect unto us, and have ſuch precious thoughts and purpoſes concerning our temporal, and Eternal well-being: this ſhould make us break out in admiration, and ſay with <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>David; Oh Lord, what is man that thou ſhouldſt take notice of him,</hi> make ſuch account of him, ſet thy heart upon him, and ſo magnifie him, as not only to make a World for him, but have ſuch precious thoughts of love to him, reſpecting both his temporal and Eternal welfare, to take him into communion with thy ſelf here in grace, and promiſe him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate communion with thy ſelf in glory?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect</hi> 2. On the Attributes of God, and here take notice of theſe things; 1. What they are: 2. The kinds of them: 3. The benefit of a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meditation on them: 4. The Reaſons why we ſhould have ſuch a ſerious meditation on them: 5. The evidences of our intereſt in them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What the Attributes of God are, <hi>ſc.</hi> Certain Eſſential properties of God, whereby he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make himſelf known unto us, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cannot come to know him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called back-parts, not that God hath any back-part, or fore-part, but becauſe we can only
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:152821:24"/>have an imperfect knowledge of him, as we have of a man, when we ſee him only by his Back; we may gueſs at him, that it is ſuch an One, but we cannot ſay expreſly it is He, unleſs we ſaw his Face.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Kinds of Attributes, they are either Incommunicable, or Communicable,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Incommunicable are ſuch, as are proper to himſelf, and not to be found in the Creature, as theſe: 1, His Eternity, <hi>Pſal</hi> 90.2. 2, His Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.33. 3, His Omniſciency, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8.39. 4, His Omnipotency, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. 5, His Immutability, <hi>James</hi> 1.17. (2.) His Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Attributes are ſuch, as are found in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as, 1. His wiſdom, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. 2, His holineſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.3. 3, His faithfulneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.1. 4, His loving kindneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.7. 5, His good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.19. 6, His Juſtice, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.5. 7, His Mercy, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. <hi>Q.</hi> Are theſe in Men, as they are in God? <hi>Anſ.</hi> No, there is a double difference, 1. In men, they are only qualities, in God they are his very Eſſence. It's an Axiom in Divinity, <hi>Quicquid eſt in Deo, eſt Deus,</hi> Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in God, is God. In the Creature they are only in the Concrete, but in God in the Abſtract. God is not only loving, but God is love, 1 <hi>Epist. John</hi> 4.16. 2, In the Creature, they are imperfect, but in ſome degrees: but in God they are perfect in their full degrees; He is ſo juſt, and ſo merciful, as he cannot be more.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Take notice of the great Benefit that will come by a ſerious Meditation on thoſe Attributes. To help you in it; 1. A ſerious Meditation on God's Eternity, will be effectual to keep us from

               <p n="1">1. On the Word of God in general: and in, and about the Word, to meditate on the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Excellency of it, the excellent properties of it, the Precepts, Promiſes, Threatnings, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. On the tranſcendent Excellency of it: Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that it is no other than an Epiſtle of the great God, written from Heaven, indited by his Spirit, conveyed by his Son, unto his Church; and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, &amp; ſealed by the blood of Martyrs. Oh, what wonderful condeſcention of the great God, is this, to his poor worthleſs Creatures, that, when he might have left us ſtill in our contracted blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:152821:29"/>and ſuffered us to grope through inward, to outward and eternal darkneſs; He ſhould cauſe the light to ſhine forth once more upon us, and reveal his mind and will, how he would have us to walk, and to worſhip him, ſo as to enjoy him in grace here, and in glory to all Eternity hereafter. How ſhould the conſideration of it affect our hearts, make us to prize and to value this bleſſed Book, to love and delight in reading of our Father's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and the rather, becauſe it's the great <hi>Charter</hi> of our Peace, our evidence for a better life, and our Eternal Inheritance, 1 Ep. <hi>John</hi> 5.13. Theſe things have I written unto you, that believe on the name of the Son of God, that you may know you have Eternal Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To meditate on the excellent properties of it; as 1. The Divinity of it, that it's all, and every part of it, divinely inſpir'd, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>laſt.</hi> 2, The infallibility of it, that it never did, or can deceive any, being the word of him, that is truth it ſelf, and hath ſaid, <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs before one Iota or title of it go unfulfilled, Luk</hi> 16.17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The All-ſufficiency of it, that it contains all things neceſſary to be known, believed, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed to ſalvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. 4, The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Efficacy of it, on the Conſcience to humble, and comfort: when Men and Angels can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by all they can ſay, or do, one word of God, dropt into the Conſcience by the Spirit of God, is able to humble the proudeſt ſinner, and raiſe up the moſt dejected Soul, ſo as to make him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, God is in it of a truth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) To meditate on the Precepts, Promiſes, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:152821:29"/>in the Word; <hi>First,</hi> Firſt, The Precepts, that they are good, and juſt, and holy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. as you may find <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 119.15.23. And when you meditate on the Precept, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that there is no Precept, but is backt with a promiſe of acceptance, aſſiſtance, and a reward. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Meditate on the Promiſes in the Word, that they are many for number, exceeding great for quantity, and precious for quality, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. All, the godly man's; called therefore the Heirs of the promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. Promiſes of all things concerning life, and godlineſs, this, and a better, that he will give grace, and glory, and with-hold no good thing, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 84. <hi>the end.</hi> That they are all, Yea, and Amen, in Chriſt Jeſus, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. Still to go to them, as the Bee to the Flower, and ſuck ſweetneſs out of them, and when you medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on them, remember ſtill, God is as faithful in performing, as gracious in promiſing, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.33. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> On the threatnings of the Word, that they are infinitely more dreadful, than the threatnings of men: the threatnings of men can reach only to the Body, but the threatnings of God unto the Soul, Men's threatnings only to this life, but God's to all Eternity, <hi>Math.</hi> 10 28 <hi>Fear not them which kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fear him who is able to deſtroy both Soul and Body in Hell;</hi> and here remember God is as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in making good his Threatnings, as his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: there's only this difference, he promiſeth that he may fulfill, but threatens that he may not fulfill. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> On the Examples in the word of mercy, and goodneſs to the obedient, and Juſtice and Severity to the diſobedient; and when you
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:152821:30"/>meditate on them, to take notice, There is no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in it but is for our inſtruction; and hath a promiſe, or a threatning in the Bowels, and Boſom, of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Above all, to meditate on the Goſpel, or the New-Covenant of Grace: and in, and about that to meditate on theſe 8. things, 1. What it is; 2. Why call'd the Covenant of grace; 3. Why a new Covenant; 4. Wherein the old Covenant and new agree, and differ; 5. What thoſe ſpecial ſpiritual things are, contain'd in the Covenant; 6. What Signs there are of a Perſon's being actually in Covenant; 7. The Means for it, and the Motives to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What it is; <hi>viz.</hi> That Second Contract, or Agreement, which God the Father made with Chriſt, and in Him with all his Elect, To give them Chriſt, and all that is Chriſt's, even all things that pertain to life, and godlineſs, upon their believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Secondly, Q.</hi> Why is this call'd a Covenant of Grace? <hi>A.</hi> In oppoſition to the Covenant of Works, which God made with <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Innocency: <hi>That</hi> promiſed Life and Salvation, upon condition of doing the whole will of God; <hi>this,</hi> only upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of believing, and giving God the glory of his grace in it; <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>3dly,</hi> Why is it call'd the new Covenant? In oppoſition to the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, made with the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Law: The old Covenant is the revelation, and diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant before the coming of Chriſt; the new Covenant, the Revelation, and Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, ſince the coming of Chriſt. <hi>4ly.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in do the old and new Covenant agree? <hi>A.</hi> In two
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:152821:30"/>things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the ſubſtance, which is one and the ſame in both; <hi>viz.</hi> Life and Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the way of receiving Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit, by Faith in Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.10, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. Then, <hi>Fifthly, Q</hi> Wherein they differ? <hi>A.</hi> In three things, the clearneſs, eaſineſs, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciouſneſs of it; <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the Clearneſs: in the new Covenant, Chriſt and the benefits that come by him are more clearly revealed unto us, than to them under the old: they had it under types, and ſhaddows, and Ceremonies, which things are now done away by Chriſt, <hi>Heb</hi> 8. <hi>laſt. Secondly,</hi> In the Eaſineſs; the ſervice of the old Covenant was a Service, they were not able to bear, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.10. But Chriſt's Yoke is eaſie, and his Burden is light, <hi>Math</hi> 11. <hi>laſt.</hi> Becauſe he hath freed us from thoſe heavy Yokes and Burdens that lay on them, as, of many coſtly Sacrifices, long and tedious Journeys, prohibition of many Meats, obſervation of many Days, Rites, and Ceremonies; from all which we are freed by Chriſt. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the Efficaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Power of it: there was leſs of the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Spirit of grace, given to ordinary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers under the Law, than to thoſe under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; this plentiful Effuſion of the Spirit, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved unto the time of Chriſt's Aſcenſion, <hi>John</hi> 7.39. <hi>Eph</hi> 4.7, 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7 18, 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(Sixthly,)</hi> What thoſe ſpecial ſpiritual bleſſings are, which are promiſed in the Covenant: which are firſt, in general, That God will be a God to them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. and a Father, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>laſt.</hi> that is, He will do, all God and a Father can, as he can do all things; and is as willing, as he is able,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:152821:31"/>
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. More particularly, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he will give them his Spirit to work all in them, and for them; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>Luke</hi> the 11. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he will give them the ſanctifying knowledge of himſelf and his will, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That he will pardon all their ſins, and look upon them as righteous in his Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 21. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That he will ſanctifie their natures, to the mortifying of their corruptions, and the quickning of their graces, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4, 5. &amp; 8. the 13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That he will take away their heart of Stone, and give a heart of Fleſh; the double Spirit, and give a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Spirit; the froward Spirit, and give a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Spirit, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. and <hi>chap.</hi> 36. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> He will not only give grace, but growth in grace, <hi>Malach.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That he will never leave the work of his grace, until he hath perfected grace in glory, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39, 40. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> To meditate of the Signs of being actually in Covenant; as, <hi>Firſt,</hi> a lively faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by love to God, and all that is God's, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Reciprocation of promiſes: as God promiſed to be our God, ſo we to be his People, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.16, 17. as he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give Chriſt, and grace, and glory, ſo we promiſe faith, and love, and new obedience. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Counterpane, or Copy of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they that enter into Covenant one with the other, you know each Party hath a Counterpane, or Copy of it: ſo is it between God and the Soul, as the Covenant is reciprocal, ſo the Copy of the Covenant is drawn on the heart, <hi>Jeremy</hi> 31.34. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They have the Spirit of God to reveal,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:152821:31"/>and make known this Covenant to them, <hi>Jeremy</hi> 31.34. and to enable them to do what is required in the Covenant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Such as are in Covenant they have the fruits, and effects of of it; as, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Softneſs of heart, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Sincerity of obedience, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19, 20. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Growth in grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Perſeverance in grace, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable care to renew their Covenant with God upon every breach of it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> To meditate on the means of getting an intereſt in the Covenant, if you do not yet find your ſelves actually in Covenant; as, <hi>First,</hi> To humble your ſelves under the abuſe of his grace in the firſt Covenant; <hi>Secondly,</hi> To give him the glory of his grace in vouchſafing to enter into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and a better Covenant, not only to give grace, but perſeverance in grace; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To be willing to Covenant with God, as he with you, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.16, 17. <hi>This Day the Lord thy God hath,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To cloſe with the great deſign of God, in ſaving of poor loſt ſinners, in making ſuch a Covenant with them in Chriſt, and in order to it to renounce the former Covenant of works, all your own righteouſneſs; and deſire with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to be found only in Chriſt, having his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs that is by faith, the righteouſneſs of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. Becauſe by the works of the Law, no Fleſh living can be juſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. The <hi>Jews</hi> going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, made void (to them) the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. Yea, and you are to renounce all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Covenants, with Sin, Satan, and the World, for God will never enter into Covenant with thoſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152821:32"/>that are in Covenant with his Enemies, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28.15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. <hi>to the end. Fifthly,</hi> To go unto God, by ſervent, and conſtant Prayer, and entreat him to remember his Covenant, and glorifie his grace in it upon you, by giving his Spirit for the ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling you to cloſe with his great Deſign in the Covenant, That he would put his Law in your heart, and write it in your inward parts, and give you that new Spirit, which may cauſe you to walk in his Statutes, and keep his Commandments, and do them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> To meditate on the many and weighty motives there are, to quicken every one to get an intereſt in this Covenant of Grace; as, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſad, and miſerable condition of all ſuch, as are without Covenant. They are without God in the World, and without hope, <hi>viz.</hi> of a better life, After this, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. They muſt look to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Covenant of works; and if Men be not able to yield obedience to any one command of God, as they ought, and yet bound to yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto all the whole Law, or no life, (do, they muſt all, or die eternally for the breach of the leaſt Commandment, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. <hi>laſt</hi>); The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this ſhould make every wicked man tremble to continue a moment in his natural, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſtate, and ſpeedily to come unto Chriſt. Yet further, conſider the miſerable condition of men in this: ſo long as they are without Covenant they cannot expect any bleſſing or mercy from God, either corporal or ſpiritual, outward or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; for all bleſſings, and mercies, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to a People, in, and by virtue of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.11. Whatſoever men have and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:152821:32"/>being out of Covenant, they have it in wrath, and not in mercy; as a curſe, and not a bleſſing, <hi>Mol.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Meditate on the happy and bleſſed eſtate of ſuch as are actually in Covenant: they have an intereſt in God, and Chriſt, his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and all that is theirs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>two laſt. Hoſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>to the end.</hi> And as all that is good, in God, and Chriſt, is yours; ſo all that evil that is yours, in Chriſt's, Your ſins, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 <hi>laſt,</hi> and your ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 63. He is afflicted in all your afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Secondly,</hi> You may go boldly to the Throne of Grace, for the ſupply of all your wants, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>laſt,</hi> and with aſſurance to be accepted, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, in whatſoever you ſhall ask, according to his will, 1 <hi>Ioh</hi> 5.14. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It's that will bring you comfort in the ſaddeſt condition you are, or can be in. When they ſpake of ſtoning <hi>David,</hi> He encouraged himſelf in the Lord his God; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5.</p>
               <p>Again, To meditate on the excellent proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Covenant, How that it is the moſt free, ſweet, full, and unchangeable Covenant; <hi>First,</hi> For the Freeneſs of it: there was nothing in Us to move him to it, but his own grace, therefore call'd a Covenant of grace; nothing requir'd on our part, but only faith, Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, <hi>Acts</hi> 16 31. <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Sweetneſs of it; you may ſee it in theſe three things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> He requires no more of us, than he promiſeth to work in us by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He promiſeth to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look all our unwilling treſpaſſes, faultings, and failings, where they are bewail'd by us; and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the will for the deed, the endeavour for the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:152821:33"/>work, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. our imperfect obedience for perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He will look upon, accept of the perfect Obedience, the full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus Chriſt for us; as if we had yielded i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> in our own Perſons, 1 Epiſt. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.1. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To meditate on the fulneſs of this Covenant, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> contains promiſes of all things concerning life, and godlineſs, this life and a better, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 4.8. That he will be a Sun, and a Shield give grace, and glory, and will with-hold no good thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> On the unchange ableneſs of this Covenant, that it is an everlaſting Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39, 40. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tenthly,</hi> To meditate on the duties you owe to God, in reſpect of this new Covenant of grace, as, <hi>First,</hi> To be ſtill admiring, and adoring the free, and rich grace of God, in making ſuch a Covenant with you, notwithſtanding you had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed this grace, in the firſt Covenant; and that he ſhould bring you forth under the diſpenſations of the new Covenant, that ſo far excels the old, as you have ſeen, in the clearneſs, eaſineſs, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciouſneſs of it; and further ſhould ſo manifeſt and magnifie his grace towards you, as to make his Word, and Rod, effectual to bring you within the Bonds of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Study well this Covenant of grace, and acquaint your ſelves, more and more with the many, and precious promiſes, contained in it: Eſpecially thoſe that moſt concern your preſent wants and neceſſities, and labour to ſuck out the ſweet, and comfort of all, by Meditation, Faith, and Prayer.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let it be your care to walk worthy of, and ſuitable to, the grace of the new Covenant; remembring you are under a better Coven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nt, than that made with them under the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore you ought to have better lives, ſeeing you have a better Mediator, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Promiſes, and better Means, than they had, and therefore ſhould have better Converſations: The myſteries of the Goſpel are more clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd to you, Chriſt's Yoke is an eaſie Yoke, and his Burden a light Burden, in compariſon what they were under; his Spirit poured out more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully than heretofore, upon ordinary Believers: &amp; therefore all theſe ſhould be, as ſo many Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo many encouragements to a morehumble, holy, ſpiritual, and Heavenly walking before the Lord; and a more thankful, chearful, faithful, and fruitful ſervice of the Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74, 75. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>to the</hi> 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>laſt.</hi>

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Having at any time relapſed into ſin, (eſpecially groſs, and ſcandalous ſin), to renew, as our humiliation under it, ſo our Covenant of more circumſpection, and watchfulneſs againſt it, after that Example, Jer. 50.5. And the rather, becauſe there is a great proneneſs in us, as well as others, unto back-ſliding, and there are continual out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goings of corruption in us, as well as others, to deal falſly with God, in our Covenant, as they, in <hi>Pſ</hi> 78.36, 37. And therefore our duty is (that who are in Covenant with God) upon our breach of Covenant, to renew our Covenant of more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection for the future, eſpecially in times of Affliction, and on Days of Humiliation, and when we are to draw neer to God in that great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

                     <hi>First,</hi> The infinite goodneſs of God in having us, in his heart, for ſo much good, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were, but before the World was, even from all Eternity.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> His Converting-providence, in bringing us forth under the light of the Goſpel, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the light of his glorious grace, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, to ſhine into our hearts, to turn us from darkneſs, to light, and from the Power of Satan, unto God; in placing us under a faithful Miniſtry, and bleſſing the Miniſtry to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and Edification, in ſaving-knowledg, and grace, when he leaves others (under the ſame Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry) in their dark, dead, Chriſtleſs, and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs condition; Amongſt other things which <hi>Beza</hi> in his laſt Will, and Teſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take notice of, and meditate on God's Protecting-providence, how he hath watched over us, and ours, from the Womb, to this very Day, protecting us from many ſins, temptations, and dangers, we have been expoſed to, and others
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:152821:37"/>have miſcarried by; as for inſtance, from the rage of Satan, malice of Men, violence of the Creature, from Fire, falls, many tormenting ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and diſeaſes, others lie groaning under; how wonderfully and graciouſly, we have been preſerv'd from the Sword, Famine, Peſtilence, in thoſe evil days that lately paſt over us: When ſo many thouſands were ſwept away by them, we and ours were made up amongſt his Jewels, had our lives given us for a prey, he turned our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and reſtor'd our liberty, and ſince length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out our tranquility, and made us dwell in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, quiet from the fear of evil, and that in the midſt of many fears, and dangers, ſad expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and great provocations; Take notice alſo of, and meditate on his providences, as over your ſelves, ſo yours, eſpecially your little ones: How wonderful is God every day in the preſervation of them; I ſhall give you an inſtance only of one. Divers being in a Family, to faſt, and pray, a little Child went out to a Pond much frozen (being Winter), either to ſlide, or whip his Top: in the Pond was made two holes, for the ſafety of the Fiſh, and taking up of Water; into one of theſe holes the Child fell: being ſoon miſſed, and ſearcht after, he was found in one with his armes ſpread over the Hole: had the Hole been wider, or he not ſo ſoon lookt after, he might have periſhed; the Reporter of it was an Eye-witneſs of the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And may not ſome of you ſpeak of the like deliverance of yours? Above all other protecting providences; I ſhall commend to your ſerious, and thankful meditation; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That God hath hitherto, and ſtill doth protect a little Flock of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:152821:38"/>Sheep in the midſt of a World of Wolves, and Lyons, and Bears, and Tygers, which are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſet on miſchief; The <hi>Second</hi> is this, that God maintains, and upholds a little grace in life, and vigour, in the midſt of ſuch an abundance of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. The reaſon is obvious, becauſe though the World be the Devil's, the Church is God's; though corruption be ours, yet Grace is the Lord's; and he hath promiſed, though the Devil, and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments rage never ſo much, <hi>Yet the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt it, Math.</hi> 16.18. and where he hath begun a good work of grace, he will never leave his own work, till he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected it in glory, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Take notice of, and meditate on God's Providing-providence, how he hath provided for you, and yours, from time to time, in all your wants, and ſtreights, at ſuch a time he raiſed up friends to you, to ſupply your wants; at ſuch a time, he ſent Cuſtomers into your Shops, and gave you vent for your Commodities; at ſuch a time he proſper'd your labours, and when you had but little, made it enough to ſatisfie you and yours. You may remember, many of you, when your eſtate and condition was very low, but now God hath ſo proſper'd you, as you have attain'd to a great Eſtate; you ſhould therefore think on the goodneſs of God to you, in it; and labour to anſwer him in the end of it, by doing the more good with it, as God requires, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.5, 6. and <hi>Jacob</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. It's ſtoried of <hi>Agathocles,</hi> a King of <hi>Sicilly,</hi> who having been a Potter's Son, would always be ſerv'd at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with Earthen Veſſels, to mind him of the mean

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:152821:39"/>of <hi>Socrates.</hi> If a Heathen, much more ſhould Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians take notice of God's gracious Diſpoſing-providences, as, amongſt others, theſe, That he gave us a beeing amongſt Men, and not amongſt Beaſts; amongſt Chriſtians, and not amongſt <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans;</hi> amongſt Proteſtants, and not amongſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts: that we were born of ſuch godly Parents, as gave us good counſel, and good example, brought us up under godly School-maſters, and Tutors, and Miniſters, to go in, and out before us, in ſoundneſs of Doctrine, and integrity of Converſation; that God gave us our Lott, and Habitation in ſuch a Place, where we found many Benefactors, and many good Counſellors, many Body, and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friends; and where we had many helps, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, and opportunities for the doing, and receiving of good: How at firſt, you thought to be of ſuch a Calling, but God diſpoſed you to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother more fit for you, and you for it; once you thought to have led a ſolitary life, and live like a Hermit, but God made you know that you were not only born for your ſelf, but the glory of God, and the publick good; you thought once to have matcht into ſuch a Family, and with ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which if you had, you had been undone, but God ſo diſpoſed, as to give in the heart of another Companion, every way more meet for you, in Religion, Diſpoſition, and Converſation, and brought you into ſuch a Family, as you have cauſe to bleſs God for it all your days, and break out, and ſay, Oh the All-wiſe, gracious, diſpoſing providence of my God, <hi>Praiſe thou the Lord, O my Soul,</hi> &amp;c. Believe it Chriſtians, it's a ſweet thing to eye God in his wiſe Diſpoſals: it will migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Take notice of, and meditate on his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting-providence, in, and under what he hath call'd us to do, and ſuffer: you may remember the time, when we have been full of fears, and doubts, how we ſhould go thorow ſuch a ſervice, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo ſuch a hardſhip, but we have graciouſly found the Lord coming in mightily to aſſiſt us, and carry us through all, to his Glory, our own, and others comfort: thus <hi>Paul</hi> found it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16, 17. And thus alſo ſhould we, did we but look up to him for it: for his promiſe is, if we acknowledge him, in all; he will order all for us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.6. If we caſt our care on him, he will take the care of us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. If we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our thoughts, and ways to him, he will eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. and by the experience we have of his preſence with us, and aſſiſtance of us, we ſhall be enabled to live by faith in him, for the future, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40.29.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Meditate on his Correcting-providence: how that; of very faithfulneſs, it is he hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected you; if he had not, you had gone on ſtill in ſuch and ſuch evil courſes, and the neglect of ſuch and ſuch duties, but (bleſſed be God) you now can ſay with <hi>David,</hi> It's good for you that you have been ſo afflicted, for you have learnt thereby to keep God's Statutes. If you had not been ſo afflicted, you ſhould have been as vain, and proud, earthly, and covetous, Senſual, and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous, as others; and therefore not to repine at the Rod, but bleſs God for it; for the truth is, as (one well) The beſt of us are but like a Boy's

                     <hi>Ninthly,</hi> To take notice of, and meditate on the Uſe, you and the People of God have made of thoſe providences: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Search and ſee, What benefit you have reaped by them: remember at ſuch a time God corrected you with ſuch a great affliction, a long ſickneſs; at ſuch a time gave you great ſucceſs in your affairs, diſtinguiſhed you from many Perſons, and Families in your enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Hath theſe diſtinguiſhing providences di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed you in your thankfulneſs, ſerviceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and fruitfulneſs? Have you been more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:152821:41"/>purged, ſpiritualiz'd, and Heavenliz'd by them? then they are ſanctified, and in mercy to you; otherwiſe not, if you be not better'd by them, but the worſe for them, more proud and wanton, forgetful of God, and others, that want them; as God hath diſtinguiſhed you in his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſo he will at laſt in his Puniſhments. <hi>Secondly,</hi> See, whether you have been quickned by them, to bring more glory to God in the Place, he hath ſet you. God hath done this and that, for you above others; Ask your own hearts, what you have done for Him above others: <hi>Hannah</hi> after many Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Tears, obtain'd a Child from the Lord; ſhe in token of thankfulneſs, gave him back again to the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.27. Have you done like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? God hath given you health, and ſtrength, and wealth, gifts and graces above others; have you given them back again, for the honouring, and ſerving Him above others? if not, you will one day repent bitterly, as he did, that had been more careful to ſerve his Maſter on Earth, the King of <hi>England,</hi> than the King of Heaven and Earth. <hi>(Woolſey).</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> See what good you have done to others by theſe diſtinguiſhing Providences. Has God's goodneſs to you, wrought more goodneſs in you to others, ſtirr'd you up to do more good to the Country, Church, State, Place, City, Family, wherein God hath ſet you? Have your Husband, Wife, Children, Servants, Friends, and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, been the better for you? if ſo, then theſe Providences have been in Mercy to you, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if God hath been ſo good to you, and you have done no more good for Him, and His; you
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:152821:42"/>have minded only your ſelves, and lived only to your ſelves; you will one day wiſh, you had been among the Number of the pooreſt, and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Beggars, than what you are, to have ſo much, and do no more good with it; yea, the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens will riſe up in Judgment, and condemn you, for they could ſay, <hi>Non nobis nati,</hi> they were not born for themſelves, but their Country; Another, <hi>Mallem mihi male eſſe, quam molliter vivere (Seneca)</hi> I had rather be ſick, than be idle, and do no good. And thus you ſee, What thoſe things are, you are to meditate on, in, &amp; about <hi>God</hi>'s merciful <hi>Providences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take notice what you are to meditate on, in, and about the Providences of his Juſtice, and Judgments; as theſe, the Equity, the Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, the Severity, the Unſupportableneſs, and the Unavoidableneſs of his Judgments, and our Duties in reſpect of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Equity of his Judgments, that God is moſt righteous in all, and can do none wrong, and puniſhes all leſs than they deſerve, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. Ignorant Perſons, and wicked Men, would make him a God, made all of mercy; but you muſt know, and conſider, He is as juſt, as he is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and Infinite in both: as, Infinite in Mercy to Pardon the Penitent, ſo Infinite in Juſtice to Puniſh the Impenitent. Whence you ſhal find, that where his Nature is laid down, He is deſcribed by his Juſtice, as well as his Mercy, <hi>Exo.</hi> 34.6, 7, 8. and <hi>Nah.</hi> 1.2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Impa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:152821:42"/>of His Wrath, <hi>Lament.</hi> 1.12: and if He would not ſpare ſin in His own Son, certainly he will not in others, that go on impenitently, and ſecurely, in any ſin; for there is no reſpect of Perſons with God. He regards not the Rich more than the Poor, the Noble than the Ignoble, the Wiſe than the Simple: He will ſpare neither King nor Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, High nor Low, Rich nor Poor, Old nor Young; no not His own People, if they ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Him, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. You only have <hi>I</hi> known of all the Families of the Earth, therefore I will ſurely puniſh you for your Iniquities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The ſeverity and terribleneſs of His Judgment in all Ages, upon Perſons, Families, Towns, Cities, Kingdoms, Countrys, all impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and incorrigible ſinners; you may ſee it in His Judgments on the old World, <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> You may read more in <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.11, 12, 13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.5, 6, 7. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.33. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.1: <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. <hi>to the end.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Meditate on the unſupportableneſs of God's Judgment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11. Who knows the power of thy anger? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.14. Can thy heart endure, or thy hands be ſtrong in the day that I ſhall deal with thee? <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 33.14. The ſinners in <hi>Zion</hi> are afraid, fearfulneſs hath ſurpriz'd the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, <hi>Who ſhall dwell with devouring Fire, and everlaſting Burnings?</hi> and <hi>Nahum.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.10.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:152821:46"/>well, there is a double love of God, general and ſpecial; 1. General to all Men, of which you may read, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.21. <hi>Jeſus beholding, loved him,</hi> (ſaith the Text, of the young Man.). 2. There is God's ſpecial love to his Elect, of which you may read, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16. <hi>John</hi> 13. Now God's general and common love is manifeſted in beſtowing on Men theſe outward temporal good things, as on the young Man, that came to Chriſt, to know what he muſt do to inherit Eternal Life; But for His ſpecial love, that is manifeſted in giving Spiritual bleſſings, as Chriſt, and his Spirit, and Grace, Faith, Repentance, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His Fatherly Correction, and Chaſtiſements, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. And therefore take heed of concluding the ſpecial love of God. becauſe of your proſperous condition, without an intereſt in Chriſt, and a work of grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Watch againſt thoſe Evils, proſperity uſually leads men into, as theſe, 1. Forgetfulneſs of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.7.20. ſo as to depart from the living God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.15. and deny him; <hi>Job</hi> 21.15. And as of God, ſo of the afflictions of <hi>Joſeph, Amos</hi> 6.6, 7. And as of God, and of others, ſo of themſelves, their own latter end, <hi>Lament.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Jeruſalem remembred not her latter end,</hi> therefore ſhe came down wonderfully: <hi>Secondly,</hi> Pride and diſdain of others, that come ſhort of their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.4, 5, 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. It's hard to keep a low Sayle under a high condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. You are to take notice of, and make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thoſe duties, which God calls you unto, in, and by your proſperity, as theſe, 1. To eye God in all, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.9. When he was about to leave his Uncle <hi>Laban,</hi> he told his Wives, God had taken away his Father's Cattle, and given them to him. And after, when he met with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eſau,</hi> and found favour in his ſight; he ſaid, <hi>I have ſeen thy face, as the face of God, Take what is brought thee, becauſe the Lord hath dealt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly with me, Gen.</hi> 32.10, 11. A great Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal writing down in his Diary, what ſuch a Lord, and ſuch a Prince, and ſuch a Pope had done for him, but not a word of God; one reading it, ſaid, This Man remembred his friends, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got God. And ſo ſtill do too many; but take heed of it, it is the next way to have God ſtrip you of all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To walk humbly under your proſperity, and the abundance of theſe outward good things; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unworthy of, and leſs than the leaſt of God's mercies. As our ſins are greater than the greateſt of God's Judgments, (<hi>Ezra</hi> 9 13.); ſo our duties leſs than the leaſt of God's mercies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 To live ſtill thankfully for his diſtinguiſhing goodneſs to you, and when you find the ſweet of any mercy, remember ſtill to give him his glory ſtill to bleſs the Lord, that takes pleaſure in his People, and delights to ſee his Servants proſper, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.27. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.19.26.5.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To ſerve the Lord the more cheerfully for
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:152821:47"/>the abundance of all his goodneſs, as having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by more leiſure from worldly imployments, to attend on the ſervice of God, and more opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and abilities for the promoting of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God amongſt others. It's noted of <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat,</hi> when the Lord proſpered him, his heart was lifted up in God's ways, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.6, 7. and <hi>David</hi>'s ſtudy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.12. <hi>What ſhall I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto the Lord for all his benefits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. To be more helpful to others, making a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of others wants out of your abundance, as the Apoſtle exhorts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. remembring we are but Stewards of what we have, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.1, and therefore be willing and ready to diſtribute to the ſupply of others wants, and neceſſities, as the Command runs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.18, 19. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To moderate our ſelves in the uſe of our Creature-comforts, and not take ſo much liberty and delight in them, as you may, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.30, 31. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.5.</p>

Laſtly,</hi> Conſider how ſoon your day of proſperity may be turn'd into a day of adverſity; Summer will not laſt all the Year, therefore wiſe men provide for Winter, the Sun will not always ſhine, the Weather will not always be calm, we know not how ſoon a Storm may ariſe, and therefore in a day of proſperity, to look for a day of adverſity, in wealth for poverty, in honour for diſhonour, in health for ſickneſs, in life for death, <hi>Job</hi> 3.25.14.14. <hi>All the days of my appointed time,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.7. And that you may be prepared for a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:152821:47"/>day of adverſity; 1. Hearken unto that of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> to <hi>Job, ch.</hi> 22.21. Acquaint thy ſelf with God, &amp; be at peace, labour to make your peace with God, by Jeſus Chriſt, and this will fit you for, &amp; enable you to bear adverſity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. 3. He that hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his Eternal ſtate, will not much regard the loſs of his temporal eſtate, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. they took joyfully the ſpoiling of their Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore hearken to that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.30. <hi>The time is but ſhort,</hi> &amp;c. Get off your hearts from Creature-comforts, and you will more eaſily part with them, when God calls for them, as the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. <hi>What do you weeping,</hi> &amp;c? Thus much of your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage under proſperous Providences.</p>
                  <p>For adverſe and ſad Providences, mind well theſe Rules, Take heed of ſome things, and practiſe others.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Take heed of ſome things, as theſe, the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up hard thoughts of God, murmuring thoughts againſt God, deſpiſing and deſponding thoughts under the Rod, envious thoughts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers proſperity.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Take heed of taking up hard thoughts of God, of queſtioning God's love under the Rod, for however proſperity be no mark of God's ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial love, yet Adverſity is, as you may ſee clearly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Whom I love, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke and chaſten. Q.</hi> But you will ſay, To whom is it a pledge of God's ſpecial love? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not to all, but ſome, not to the wicked, but the godly; Not to <hi>Cain,</hi> but to <hi>Abel;</hi> not to <hi>Eſau,</hi> but to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. To all that unfeignedly love God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17. <hi>I love them that love me. Q</hi> How ſhall I know, I truly love God? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thus,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:152821:48"/>1. If thou love nothing out of him, or without him, or in compariſon of him, and can'ſt readily part with all for him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. <hi>end.</hi> 2. If thou art one that makeſt conſcience of yielding obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, univerſal and conſtant obedience in thy deſires and endeavours, to all his Commandments, <hi>John</hi> 10.15.21. <hi>Q.</hi> But when is afflictions an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God's ſpecial love? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Only then when they are ſanctified. <hi>Q.</hi> How may we know that? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Briefly thus, when they lead men to repentance and a reformation of heart and life; <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19. <hi>Job</hi> 34.29.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Take heed of murmuring, and repining-thoughts under your afflictions, and that 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is that which God expreſly forbids, and exemplarily puniſheth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10. 2. That which makes Men like unto the Devil, for this is his ſin and puniſhment, who is ſtill repining and riſing up againſt God, provoking him the more, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. 3. It's fruitleſs and bootleſs, to ſtrive with God, he will be too hard for men, and will afflict them the more, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.19. Do they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke me to anger, do they not provoke themſelves to the confuſion of their faces? And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.22. Do we provoke the Lord to jealouſie, are we ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than he? 3. You do by your impatience, but afflict your ſelves the more, make your burthen the heavier, <hi>Impatiens aegrotus crudelem facit me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicum.</hi> It is juſt with God to lay on more ſtrokes, as a Father on a ſtubborn Childe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take heed of deſpiſing and deſponding thoughts under the Rod. God forbids both, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5. <hi>My Son deſpiſe not the chaſtning of the Lord
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:152821:48"/>nor faint, when thou art rebuked of him;</hi> a Chriſtian muſt be careful to avoid both Extreams, deſpiſing and deſponding thoughts; <hi>Firſt,</hi> Not to deſpiſe the Rod, by ſlighting it, that which the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.9. Thou haſt ſtricken them, but they have not grieved. Though it be a ſin to faint under it, yet it is a greater, to ſlight it and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe it, and therefore made the aggravation of <hi>Ahaz</hi> wickedneſs, [This is that <hi>Ahaz,</hi> which in his afflictions treſpaſſed more &amp; more, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 28.22.] <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take heed of deſponding thoughts, for if thou ſaint in the day of adverſity, thy ſtrength is but ſmall, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.10. No ſin more diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to God, to Chriſt, to the Spirit, to a Man's Soul than Deſperation; that which robs God of the glory of his grace, Chriſt of the glory of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the Spirit of the glory of his Power, and ſinks Soul and Body into everlaſting deſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Take heed of envious thoughts of others proſperity, that which the beſt are ſubject to, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their own adverſity, as you may ſee in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 73.3. until he went into the Sanctuary, and ſaw the end of ſuch ungodly proſperous ones, how ſuddenly they were brought to deſolation, even in a moment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.19. And therefore let not thy heart envy ſinners, <hi>&amp;c. Pro</hi> 22.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the things to be practiſed, they are theſe, 1. In the day of adverſity, conſider, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.14. Conſider, 1. Whence-ever it comes, who or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever be the Inſtrument, God is the Author, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>Is there any evil in the City, and I have not done it?</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.10. <hi>Affliction comes not out of the duſt, neither doth trouble ſpring out of the ground, Job</hi> 5.6. But from an allwiſe diſpoſing providence;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:152821:49"/>Can a Bird fall into a ſnare, where there is no Ginn? <hi>Shall there be any evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it? Amos</hi> 3.6, 7. The Bird ſeems to be taken by chance, and yet taken by providence; though the Bird did not ſee the ſnare, yet the Fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler did, and did ſet it purpoſely for him: So affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions may ſeem accidental to us, but yet intended by God; though we do not fore-ſee them, yet God did fore-appoint them, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.3. See more to this purpoſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 45.7. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider what they come for, <hi>ſc.</hi> for ſin. Though there be other cauſes, yet this is always one cauſe, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.39. <hi>Wherefore doth the living man complain,</hi> &amp;c? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. <hi>laſt. Miea.</hi> 7. <hi>I will patiently bear the indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned,</hi> If ſin lies heavy, all afflictions will be light. <hi>Luther</hi> gives this reaſon, why he ſlighted the rage of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the Emperor, and all his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, They are all little to me, (ſaith he) becauſe ſin is ſo weighty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider to what end they come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>All things work together for good, Gen.</hi> 15.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. He corrects us not for his pleaſure, but for our profit, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19. I know this ſhall turn to my Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Be careful to juſtifie God, in, and under all, even the greateſt afflictions. As <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. Thou haſt puniſhed us leſs than we deſerve. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faithfulneſs thou haſt corrected me: and the Church, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. It's the Lord's mercy we are not conſumed, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 24.15. The command is, Glorifie God in the Fire, <hi>ſc.</hi> of Affliction, which is as a Fire to try you, humble, purge you, and purifie you.</p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:152821:49"/>
                  <p n="5">5. Be filent and patient under it, as <hi>Job.</hi> 1. <hi>laſt.</hi> and <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 9.9. Remembring and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wnatſoever your ſufferings are; 1. They are from a Lord, whoſe will cannot be reſiſted; and a Father whoſe will ought readily to be obeyed; a wiſe Father, that knows what is better for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, than they do for themſelves, a compaſſionate Father, that will not afflict too much, becauſe he knows whereof they are made, that they are but duſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. nor too long, leaſt the Spirit faint, and the Soul that he hath made, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe whatſoever your ſufferings are they are little or nothing, in reſpect of what our ſins made Chriſt to ſuffer. 2. In reſpect of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and bitter things many of his Saints have, and do ſuffer. 3. Thoſe evils our ſins deſerve we ſhould ſuffer. 4. Thoſe Eternal ſufferings Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd us from. 5. That exceeding exceſſive weight of glory that will follow theſe ſufferings, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In reſpect of thoſe many ſweet, gracious and holy ends God hath in the Afflictions of his; which you ſaw before in your Meditations on God's ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting grace.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To hearken unto, and obey the voice of God in his Rod, <hi>Mica.</hi> 6.9. <hi>The Lord's Voice cryeth unto the City, &amp;c.</hi> The Rod of God hath a Voice, as well as the Word: when Men will not hearken unto, and obey God's Voice in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Word, then God ſends his Rod, and awakens Conſcience, opens Mens Ears, and Seals up inſtructions. <hi>Q.</hi> But what is the Voice of the Rod, what doth it teach and inſtruct men in? <hi>Anſ.</hi> That you have in four places of Scripture;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:152821:50"/>1. That of <hi>Job</hi> 22.21. <hi>Acquaint thy ſelf with God, and be at peace, ſo good ſhall come unto thee.</hi> 2. That, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.39. Wherefore doth the living man complain, let him ſearch, and trie his ways, and turn again unto the Lord. 3. That of <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6. Humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God, and he will exalt you in due time. 4. That, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.31. Caſt away all your tranſgreſſions, and make you a new Heart, and a new Spirit, <hi>For why will you die, O Houſe of Iſrael!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. To be thankful, that as God of faithfulneſs hath corrected us, ſo of the ſame faithfulneſs he hath not taken away his loving kindneſs; That he hath corrected us in ſo much meaſure and mercy, dealt not with us according to our deſerts, but the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his free, tender, and unchangeable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; our afflictions not ſo many and great, but God's mercies more and greater, if not in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, yet in ſpirituals: though poor in the World, yet rich in Chriſt, though we want the ſmiles of the World, you have the favour of the great God, though not the riches of the World, yet we have the riches of grace, though not the pleaſures of the World, yet the peace of a good Conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Not only to be thankful for them, but joyful in them, and under them, though not in reſpect of the nature of them, which is evil, for ſo they are not joyous, but grievous, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.

This is the meaning of that <hi>James</hi> 1.2. My brethren, count it all joy, when you fall into divers Temptations, or Afflictions.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:152821:50"/>There are two Sights (ſaith <hi>Luther</hi>) the Devil moſt delights-in, To ſee a wicked man merry, and a Saint ſorrowful: but there are two Sights that do intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably vex him, <hi>ſc.</hi> To ſee a ſinner mournful for his ſin, and a Saint joyful under his ſufferings, <hi>Luther</hi>'s <hi>Colloq.

                  <head>The Fifth Head, concerning the Worſhip and Service of God.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. About this, to meditate on theſe ſew things: What it is, Where, and When, and How, and Why we are to worſhip God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What it is: for the underſtanding of this, to conſider; Servants (you know) owe unto their Lord a ſervice of honour, and of labour, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and proviſion they have from them; and ſuch do we owe to our Soveraign Lord and Maſter, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. So that this worſhip of God, it is that Homage, and ſervice, which every one owes unto Him, and which he requires and expects from them, and for their Creation, Redemption, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the daily protection, and proviſion, he makes for them, <hi>Math.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.12. and verſ. 21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.1, 2. And here to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; This Worſhip of God, it's either External, or Internal; <hi>First,</hi> External, God is to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with the Body, and every part of it, <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſell on his face, and worſhipped, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Moſes</hi> bowed his head, and worſhipped, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.32. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> lifted up his hands to God, and worſhipped; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.4. <hi>Jeſus lifted up his eyes to Heaven, and prayed, John</hi> 17.1. The reaſon is, becauſe the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Saints ſhall be glorified with God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, &amp; therfore they are to glorifie him with their Bodies here, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. <hi>I beſeech you Brethren, by the mercies of God, preſent your Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God. Secondly,</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal worſhip, is a worſhipping God with the Spirit, as well as the Body; it being that, God eſpecially
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:152821:51"/>calls for, <hi>John</hi> 4.24. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. And this is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called, <hi>a fearing of God, Deut.</hi> 6.13. <hi>a loving of God, Jam.</hi> 2.5. <hi>a delighting in God, Pſal.</hi> 37.3. and, <hi>a truſting in God, Pſal.</hi> 16.1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Place, where he is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped: it is not only in this, and that place, as ignorant ſuperſtitious perſons fancy, but He is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where to be worſhipped; and, that in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of all thoſe religious duties, which He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, in publick, private, and ſecret, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 2.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.1. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>Job</hi> 1.5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. <hi>laſt. Mat.</hi> 6.6. Then,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For the Time that he is to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by us: as in all places, ſo at all times; as on the Week days, by beginning, continuing, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the day with him, ſo eſpecially on his own day, the Sabbath-day; becauſe although every day be his, yet this in a ſpecial manner His, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.24. This is the day which the Lord hath made, this is the Day which he hath ſanctified, and ſet apart wholly for the worſhip of Himſelf, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 58. <hi>laſt.</hi> And as this is the day he made for his own glory, ſo for Man's good; the good of his Body, and of his Soul. The good of his Body, that he might not tire out himſelf in the ſervice of the World; but eſpecially the good of his ſoul, that he might by a Sabbath on Earth, be minded of, and fitted for an everlaſting Sabbath in Heaven; by communion with God in Ordinances here, he might be made to long after that place, where he hath promiſed to be all in all, without Ordinances, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.22, 23. To this end, he hath appointed it to be the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-day, and Market-day, and Feaſting-day, and Sealing-day to the Soul; therefore in a ſpecial
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:152821:52"/>manner, to be careful of giving God his worſhip upon this day, in the obſervance and performance of all thoſe duties of piety and mercy, that he requires from you in publick, private, and ſecret: and here to mark, that you ſpend not only a part, but the whole day in the worſhip and ſervice of God, and that upon theſe accounts; <hi>Firſt,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He reſted the whole day, &amp; created nothing the Seventh-day, but finiſhed all before on the Six days; <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe he ſanctified, and ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the whole day for Himſelf, and therefore not to rob him of any part, ſeeing he hath dealt ſo bountifully with us, as to give us Six days for the ſervice of our ſelves, and reſerved but One for the ſervice of Himſelf. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of God's Worſhip on that Day are ſo many and weighty, as a whole Day is little enough to perform them as they ought.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth Circumſtance, that is eſpecially to be thought on, is the right manner, How we are to worſhip God: becauſe God looks not ſo much to the matter, as the right manner of worſhipping Him, and abhorrs and rejects the work, without the right manner, as you may ſee fully, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.11. <hi>to the</hi> 21. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.8, 9. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. <hi>laſt. Q</hi> Well, what is this right manner of worſhipping God? <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is to worſhip Him by a right Rule, from a right Principle, and to a right End; 1. By a right Rule, <hi>ſc.</hi> the Rule of God's Word, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.9. According to his own Inſtitutions, and not Mens Inventions; In <hi>vain do you wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me, &amp;c.</hi> 2. From a right Principle, <hi>ſc.</hi> in the Name of Chriſt, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.17, and the ſtrength of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. From Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:152821:52"/>Love, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.1. 3. To a right end, <hi>ſc.</hi> the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and the Salvation of your Souls, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Q.</hi> But what are thoſe Rules in the Word, according to which we are to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God? <hi>Anſ. firſt,</hi> More general, as theſe; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and affection before; attention and reverence in; and meditation and practiſe after, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.2 <hi>laſt. Luke</hi> 2.19. <hi>John.</hi> 13.17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> More ſpecial Rules for the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God, are ſuch, as reſpect the ſanctifying of the Sabbath, Prayer to God, Hearing of the Word; Reading of the Scriptures, Receiving of the Lord's Supper, ſinging of Pſalms, religious Faſting, and Feaſting, and holy Conference. For the acceptable, comfortable and profitable uſe of theſe, you are to meditate on ſome things before, in, and after every one: I ſhall but name a few, to help your Memories, and quicken your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the right ſanctifying of the Sabbath, to take notice of, and meditate on theſe things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in, and after the Sabbath; <hi>Firſt,</hi> Before the Sabbath, to remember the Sabbath before it comes. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To prepare for it, by order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Worldly affairs, ſo as they may not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you; and to ſequeſter your thoughts from all other things, that you may intend the duties of the Sabbath, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> When the Sabbath is come, to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate it as a holy Reſt to the Lord your God, not thinking your own thoughts, or ſpeaking your own words, or doing your own pleaſure, but the Lord's, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 58.13. To begin, continue, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:152821:53"/>end the Sabbath with God. And that you may do ſo, to obſerve theſe things; <hi>First,</hi> To riſe early on the Sabbath, after the Example of Chriſt; and when you awake, to bleſs God for another day of grace: in riſing up, to think on your Reſurrection at the laſt Day to glory: in putting on of your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, to think on the command of putting on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>end.</hi> After you have Apparel'd your ſelves, to remember the duties requir'd of you before, in, and after the publick Aſſemblies: <hi>First,</hi> Before, to ſequeſter your thoughts from all things of the World, and the Fleſh, to mind only, and wholly God, his Day, and Worſhip. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To pray by your ſelves, and with the Family for God's preſence, with aſſiſtance in, and bleſſing on his Ordinances to you, and yours, and all his; eſpecially on the Miniſtry of the Word, that it may be made effectual to all the ends, he hath appointed it, as the conviction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, humiliation, conſolation, edification, and ſalvation of all thoſe that belong to the Election of grace. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As you are going to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies, to remember where you are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that you are going into the Preſence, not only of men, but God; that-God, who will be ſanctified by all that draw nigh to him, or will be ſanctified upon them, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. To conſider alſo, what you are going about; a buſineſs of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt conſequence in the World, To converſe with God, and to enjoy communion with God, and hear that Word, which will make you better, or worſe, ſoften, or harden you; will bring you neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Heaven, or Hell; and will be, either the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of life, or death to you, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:152821:53"/>As you are entring into the publick Aſſemblies, to think, and ſay, with <hi>Jacob,</hi> How dreadful is this place? It is no other than the Gate of Heaven, to ſet your ſelves in the preſence of the great God, and carry your ſelves there, with all fear, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence; ſeeing there are not only Men, but the Angels, and the Great and Holy God, to take notice, both of your inward, and outward beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: And ſee you ſtay, and not depart without the Bleſſing. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> After the publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, as you go home, to meditate on what you have heard; when you come home, ſearch the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, whether things are ſo; to repeat, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with thoſe in your Family about it; to preſs the remembrance, and practiſe of what you have heard, on your ſelves, and them; after this, to go apart, and ſpend the reſt of the day in Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what you have profited; and in meditation on the Word, and Works of God, and that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And then praiſe God, for one Sabbath more, liberty of communion with Him, his Preſence with you, aſſiſtance of you, and bleſſing of his Ordinances to you; and ſo end the day, as you began it. As
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:152821:54"/>you gave Him the firſt of your thoughts, when you roſe; ſo give Him the laſt of your thoughts when you lie down, that ſo your dreams may ſavour of your Sabbath-days exerciſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> After the Sabbath, to hold forth in your lives, and converſations, all you have heard, and prayed for; that ſo the bleſſing of the Sabbath may bring a bleſſing on all your labours the Week following, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <hi>First,</hi> Before Hearing, remember whom you go to hear, not only Man, but God, who ſpeaks in, and by Man, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe man can but ſpeak to the Ear, beg the Lord to give his Spirit, that may ſpeak to the heart. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Spirit may make the Word effectual to the end God hath appointed it, take heed you come not with prejudice againſt the Miniſter, or the Word ſpoken by him, <hi>James</hi> 1.21. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.1. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That you endeavour to bring, humble, honeſt, and upright hearts to the hearing of the Word, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.15. <hi>Micah</hi> 2.7. <hi>Doth not my word do good to him that walks uprightly?

               <p>
                  <hi>Tenthly,</hi> To meditate, (if you would have the comfort of the forenamed Priviledges); To medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate (I ſay) on the Evidences of an actual and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al intereſt in Chriſt: and that, 1. Becauſe it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly commanded, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. Examine your ſelves whether you be in the faith, <hi>Know ye not that Ghriſt is in you,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Becauſe the moſt do deceive themſelves herein, flatter themſelves that they are Chriſt's, and Chriſt is theirs; becauſe they are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into his Name, and make a profeſſion of him: to whom Chriſt will ſay at the laſt Day, <hi>I know you not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.25. And therefore to ſearch and ſee, the intereſt you have in Him, be not only no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal and profeſſional, but actual and real; <hi>Q.</hi> Well then, How may we know it? <hi>Anſ.</hi> By the Grounds of it, the Means of it, and the Fruits of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the Grounds of it, whence it ariſeth; and they are theſe. 1. A ſight and ſenſe of their loſt condition, that they came into the World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt: before Men be convinced of this, they will never look out after Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. 2. It ariſeth from ſound Humiliation, under the fight and ſenſe of their loſt condition, ſo as to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, upon it, to break off the League between the Soul and every ſin: for a Graft muſt be cut off from the old Stock, before it can be ſet into a new; This you may find in thoſe new Converts, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:152821:67"/>And the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.29. 2. You may know it by the Means of it: now theſe are <hi>four.</hi> whereof there are <hi>two</hi> on Chriſt's part, ſc. His Word, and his Spirit; and <hi>two</hi> on our part, ſc. Faith and Love: By theſe, as ſo many Bands and Ligaments, the union is made between Chriſt and the Soul. By the <hi>two</hi> former, God draws the Soul home to Chriſt; By the <hi>two</hi> latter, he unites and knits it to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Word of Chriſt: that is the Ordinance, by which he cuts them off from the old Stock, and ingrafts them into the new, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. therefore called the ingrafted Word, <hi>James</hi> 1.21. Now Souls are cut off from the old Stock, by ſound Humiliation under their ſinful and miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by nature, ſo as to be willing to have the League broken between the Soul and every ſin, to part with all for Him: And they come to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted to Him, when they are made willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Him on Goſpel-terms, not only as their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but their Ruler.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Means, and the principal, is the Spirit of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> which the Lord gives effectually to accompany his Word, for the cutting them off from the old Stock, and ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into the new: and this the Spirit doth by convincing them of ſin, righteouſneſs, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8. By being in them, firſt a Spirit of Bondage, and then of Adoption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 15. By mortifying of their Corruptions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. and quickning them with Grace, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10, 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another Means, or Band of our union with, and intereſt in Chriſt, is a lively Faith, taking us off
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:152821:67"/>from our own righteouſneſs, and cauſing us to reſt, and rely only on the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, for Juſtification and Salvation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4th.</hi> Means, or Band, is an unfained Love to Chriſt for his lovely Self, and all his Members for his ſake, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You may know it by the fruits of it, which are eſpecially theſe; 1. A through change of heart and life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. 2. Subjection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Laws and Commandments, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.15.21. &amp; 15.14. Then are you my friends, if you do whatſoever I command you, and <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. 3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to him in heart and life, doing and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, living and dying, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5, 6. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.6. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. 4. A conſtant adherence to him in faith, love, and obedience, with full purpoſe of heart not to depart from him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tenthly,</hi> To meditate on what we are to do for the getting, and clearing up our intereſt in Chriſt, and all he hath done, and ſuffer'd for us: to this end mind well a few directions; as, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Look to this, that you be throughly convinc't of, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled under your ſinful and miſerable condition out of Chriſt, ſo as to find your ſelves in a loſt, and undone condition, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.10. Sick in Soul with the confideration of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.13. Burdned with, and weary of your ſins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. And pricked in your hearts, as they, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. for this is the firſt work of the Spirit of God, in bringing in a Soul to Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the convincing him, and humbling him under his ſin, and miſery by reaſon of ſin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To hunger, and thirſt after an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:152821:68"/>in Chriſt, above all other things in the World, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.1. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.17. ſo, as with the Apoſtle, <hi>To account all things but loſs, and dung, in compariſon of it,</hi> Phil. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You are to be willing to take Him on Goſpel-terms, ſuch as he therein offers himſelf; as theſe, <hi>Firſt,</hi> To take Him in all his Titles, and Offices, not only as your alone Jeſus, but Lord and Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>end, Put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Be willing to deny our ſelves, and <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

For, as a Noble Lord ſaid well, That Perſon may be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that thinks to ſave any thing by his Religion, but his Soul: meaning, his Religion might coſt him the loſs of all. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Give up your ſelves to Him in a Univerſal, ſincere and conſtant obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and conformity to Him, and all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; expreſly requir'd, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14. <hi>John</hi> 15.14. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> You are to endeavour to lay hold on Him, and cloſe with Him, and be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him by faith, and love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.19, 20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>John</hi> 14.21. And that you may, to wait conſtantly on the Miniſtry of the Word, and beg the Spirit of God, effectually to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it, for the begetting, and working of this faith, and love, whereby you may be actually, and really united to him, and made one with him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> To meditate on the motives and incouragements you have to get and clear up your

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider the happy eſtate of a man in Chriſt: he is freed from all, that is truly evil, and inſtated in all that is truly good; <hi>Firſt,</hi> He is freed from all evil, both of ſin, and puniſhment, from the evil of ſin, both the guilt of it, and the filth of it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He is inſtated in all that is good: As the Wife is by her marriage, in all the honours, rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, pleaſures of her Husband; ſo is the believing Soul, in all the honours, riches, and pleaſures of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>end.</hi> As Chriſt is a King, ſo are Believers made Kings to God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:152821:69"/>A third motive may be this, The great willingneſs, and readineſs of Jeſus Chriſt to receive, and ſave poor loſt ſinners, ſuch as are willing to take Him, and accept of Him upon Goſpel-terms; this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in theſe Particulars.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In that he offers Himſelf freely to all without exception of any that will come to him in a way of faith and love, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55 1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In that he invites all to come to him, that find their want and need of him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. and promiſes to caſt away none that come to him, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In that he ſends his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to woe, and beſeech them in the name of Chriſt to come in, and be reconcil'd to God; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In that he bewails their folly that will ſtand out againſt him, and their own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. <hi>Oh Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, that killeſt the Prophets, how often would I have gathered thy children together, as the Hen gathers her chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, and you would not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> You are to take notice, how you are to walk worthy of, and ſuitable to, ſo dear a Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and precious Saviour, by imitating him in his carriage, both towards God, and Man, in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſufferings: 1. His doings, 1 Epiſt. <hi>John</hi> 2.6. He that ſaith, he abides in him, ought to walk as he walked; <hi>Q.</hi> But you will ſay, Can any walk, as he walked? He was void of all ſin, we are ſull
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:152821:69"/>of ſin. A. There's a double (As); one that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports Equality, and another Similitude: as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports equality, it's impoſſible for any to walk as he walked; but as it imports ſimilitude and likeneſs, ſo we may, and muſt walk after him. As a Scholar that writes after his Maſter's Copy, he begins e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Line, as his Maſter begins, and ends as he ends; he frames every Letter as his Maſter frames it, joyns letters and ſyliables together, as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter doth, though there be no equality: he cannot write as well as his Maſter, yet there is a ſimilitude, he labours to imitate, and write like his Maſter; So true Chriſtians, though they cannot live, and walk ſo exactly, as Chriſt did, yet they labour to come as neer to him, as they can, to imitate, and follow him, though not in his divine acts, which he did as God, and as Mediator, which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, yet in his moral and humane acts, which he did as Man; ſo they labour to make him their only pattern in their carriages, both towards God and man; <hi>Firſt,</hi> In their carriage to God: now for his carriage towards God, that was full of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, full of ſaith, full of zeal, full of heavenly-mindedneſs: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Full of Piety, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26.

               <p>IN, and about him, to meditate on theſe things; <hi>First,</hi> What he is. <hi>Secondly</hi> What his Offices. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What ſigns you have of the Spirit's Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation. 4. Motives to get him. 5. Means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him; and 6. The means to preſerve and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe communion with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What the Spirit of God, or the Holy Ghoſt is, <hi>viz.</hi> the Third Perſon in the ſacred Trinity, proceeding from the Father and the Son. And here to take notice of three things; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he is a diſtinct Perſon from the Father and the Son, and the Third Perſon in Sacred Trinity, 1 Epiſt. <hi>John</hi> 5.7. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he is true and very God, as well as the Father and the Son, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; 1. By teſtimony of the Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3, 4. Why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie unto the Holy Ghoſt? thou haſt not lied unto man, but
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:152821:71"/>God: 2. By Reaſon, 1. Becauſe He is the Author, and Inditer of the Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.25. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. 2. Becauſe the Scripture aſcribes thoſe At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to him, that are proper to God, as Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. Omniſciency, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſency, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.17. Omnipotency, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 11.2. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe thoſe works are applied to him, which are proper to God, as Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. and Conſervation, <hi>Job</hi> 33.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.6. Regeneration, and Sanctification, <hi>John</hi> 3.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Becauſe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip is given to him, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go Baptize them in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Therefore true and very God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That he proceeds from the Father and the Son, is evident, <hi>John</hi> 15.26. and hence he is call'd the Spirit of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. and the Spirit of the Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. and ſo much the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies, becauſe he is ſpired, or brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed from them, as you may ſee further, <hi>John</hi> 16.14, 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To meditate on the Offices of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and theſe either reſpect Chriſt, his Word, or his Church; <hi>Firſt,</hi> For thoſe reſpecting Chriſt, they are theſe; <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Spirit formed Chriſt's humane nature in the Womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary, Luke</hi> 1.35, 36. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Holy Ghoſt anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Jeſus Chriſt, as he was Man with gifts, and graces, and that without meaſure, and having thus conſecrated him, and furniſhed him with gifts, for the great office and work of a Mediator, he with God the Father ſent him into the World, for the accompliſhing that work, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.1. and 11.2. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.38. <hi>John</hi> 3.34. <hi>John</hi> 1.32. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:152821:71"/>The Holy Ghoſt deſcending from Heaven, and reſting upon him viſibly in the ſhape of a Dove. did publickly ſhew him, and Seal him in his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt, who was crucified, was the Son of God, the true Meſſiah, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31.32. He witneſſeth alſo to the Doctrin of Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, in which he was declared mightily to be the Son of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Offices of the Spirit, in, and about the Word of God, take notice, firſt, 'twas He inſpir'd holy Men of God with the mind, and will of God, infallibly dictated it unto them, and guided them in the penning, or writing of it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.16. <hi>Mark</hi> 12 36. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He quickens the Word, ſo as to make it effectual to quicken dead Souls: without Him 'tis but a dead and a killing Letter, <hi>John</hi> 6.63. He makes it quick and lively in operation, to the dividing between the Soul and the Spirit, the Joynts and the Marrow, the ſearching-out, and diſcovering the ſecrets of the heart, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. It is he that ſpeaketh by it to the Churches, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Rev</hi> 14 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> His Offices, in reſpect of the Church and People of God, theſe are either common to all, or peculiar to the Elect; <hi>Firſt,</hi> For thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, they are ſuch as theſe; <hi>Firſt,</hi> To give life, and preſerve life in all, <hi>Job</hi> 33.4. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 139.14, 15. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To beſtow gifts, and abilities on men, for their particular callings, and functions, both ſacred and civil, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Judges</hi> 11.29. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:152821:72"/>Reſtraining-grace, whereby they are kept from many evils, which they would otherwiſe run into, as <hi>Abimelech,</hi> Gen. 20.6. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To act and over-act all the gifts, and parts, and power of men to his own glory, and the good of his Church and People, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For thoſe that are peculiar to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, they are ſuch as theſe: <hi>Firſt,</hi> To unite them unto Chriſt their head, and the myſtical Body of Chriſt the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. 1 Cor. 6.17. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To inhabit or dwell in them, as his Houſe, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of righteouſneſs, how that there is none in them to make them ſtand acceptable in the ſight of God, the Garment of their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and good works is a Garment too ſhort to cover their nakedneſs: their own righteouſneſs is but as a filthy Rag, but the righteouſneſs of Chriſt that is a perfect righteouſneſs, ſuch as God accepts for poor ſinners, and makes them ſtand ſo righteous in God's ſight, as if they had never ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; this appears, in that Chriſt is gone to the Father, which he could not have done, if he had not fulfilled all righteouſneſs. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how that he has judged and condemned the Serpent and his Seed, the Devil, and the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:152821:72"/>wicked World, ſo as they ſhall never prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Elect, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it;</hi> and that there is true and ſound judgment to be found only in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and not in any Idolatrous and falſe Religion; and that Chriſt hath the government of his Church upon his own Shoulders, and all that ſubject and ſubmit unto his Government, ſhall by it, judg and condemn, at laſt, the wicked World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To humble them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and mortifie in them the deeds of the Fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> To quicken them with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. Regenerate and ſanctifie them, <hi>John</hi> 3.5. and Evidence it to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> To help them in, and under all their infirmities in duty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>John</hi> 14.26. <hi>Eighthly,</hi> To direct, and guide them in all their ways, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.10. <hi>Ninthly,</hi> To ſupport, and comfort them in all their ſorrows, and ſufferings, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. <hi>John</hi> 4.26. <hi>Tenthly,</hi> To witneſs to their Spirits, that they are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> To Seal them up to the Day of Redemption, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> To be the earneſt and firſt fruits of their Eternal Salvation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To confirm, ſtrengthen, and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them in every good word and work to the end, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12, 13. Again,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To take notice of, and meditate on the Evidences you have of the receiving, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling of the Spirit of God in you, becauſe, If any have not the Spirit, he is none of Chriſt's, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. 1 Ep. <hi>John</hi> 4.13. Hereby we know he dwells in us, and we in him, by the Spirit which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:152821:73"/>he hath given us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.24. <hi>Q.</hi> But how may we know that we have receiv'd the Spirit, and that he dwells in us? <hi>A.</hi> Thus, 1. By the way, and means, in and by which he is given, and receiv'd; and that is the Miniſtry of the Word, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44. <hi>Whilſt Peter ſpake, the Holy Ghoſt fell on thoſe that heard him;</hi> and hence the Miniſtry of the Goſpel is call'd the Miniſtry of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. and Men are ſaid to receive the Spirit, by the hearing of Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> You may know you have the Spirit by this, if you can finde the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going acts, and operations of the Spirit, upon the hearts of the Elect: If he be an enlightening, enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, mortifying, ſanctifying, quickning, ſtrengthning, and eſtabliſhing Spirit in you, as you know you have life, by your breathing, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, walking; ſo you may know you have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, if he breathe and move in you, and enable you to walk in the ways of God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; more eſpecially by this, if you find him to be a ſpirit of ſanctification in you, to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you throughout in your whole man, and in your whole Converſation; for He is a Spirit of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. and ſanctifieth all his, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. ſo, as with <hi>David,</hi> to hate every falſe way, and have reſpect to every command of God, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.6.12.8. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You may know it by this, if you be careful not to quench the Spirit, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19. or grieve the Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. but heedfully to hearken to his Voice, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30.21. and follow his guidance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By this, if you go wholly out of your ſelves in every duty, and enter upon it, as, in the name of Chriſt, ſo, by the ſtrength of his Spirit, as you are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:152821:73"/>
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10. and <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.16. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If you find that you have not yet received the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then to meditate on the many, and weighty motives there are, to quicken you to labour after the Spirit. I will but name a few, drawn from the Neceſſity, and the Utility of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is an abſolute Neceſſity of having the Spirit of God, and that in theſe two reſpects. 1. Becauſe, without the Spirit of Chriſt, you can receive no grace from Chriſt, for it is the Spirit that is the ſole Author, and Worker of grace in any, therefore called the Spirit of Grace, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. And the Spirit of Sanctification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. and the ſpirit of knowledge, and the fear of the Lord, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11.2. 2. Becauſe, without the Spirit, you cannot perform any duty; ſo as to pleaſe the Lord, and to profit by it. As for inſtance, (1.) Not hear the Word, for without the Spirit, the Word is but a dead and killing Letter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. It was he that opened the heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> to attend unto what was ſpoken, ſo as to live by it, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. (2.) Not to pray effectually without the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Many and great will be the benefits that will come to you, by having the Spirit: 1. He will be a Spirit of Inhabitation to dwell in you, honour you ſo far, as to make you his Houſe and Temple, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. 2. He will be a Spirit of Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to enlighten you with the knowledge of God's mind and will, to teach you all things, <hi>John</hi> 16.12. and bring all things to your remembrance, <hi>John</hi> 14.26. 3. A Spirit of Sanctification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. To ſanctifie you throughout, in Spirit, Soul, and Body, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. To inrich you with all ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:152821:74"/>graces, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. (4. A Spirit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, to cheer up your Spirits in and under af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>John</hi> 14.16. (5. A Spirit of Interceſſion, teaching to pray, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. (6. A Spirit of Direction, to guide you in all your ways, and lead you into all truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. and 16.5. In a word, a Spirit of Adoption and Salvation, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.16. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. and therefore in all theſe reſpects, to labour after the Spirit of Chriſt. But you will ſay, What muſt we do to procure this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?</p>
               <p n="5">5. You muſt take notice of, and meditate on the means of procuring the Spirit, which are, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, theſe, 1. You are to give the Spirit the glory, that is due to him; Well then, <hi>Q.</hi> What muſt we do to procure the Spirit? <hi>A.</hi> 1. You are to give the Spirit the glory, that is due to him by acknowledging him to be true and very God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way equal with the Father and the Son; to believe in him, and reſt on him, for illumination, ſanctification, and ſalvation, as well as the Father, and the Son: for, the ignorance and unbelief of this, our Saviour ſhews to be the cauſe, why the World receives him not, <hi>John</hi> 14.17. <hi>Secondly,</hi> You are to know and acknowledge that by nature you want the Spirit of God, and thereupon to hunger and thirſt after him: for the promiſe is, he will pour out his Spirit upon ſuch, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 44.3. <hi>John</hi> 7 37, 38. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You are to attend, and wait upon God in the Miniſtry of the Word, wherein the Spirit is given, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> You are to love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and expreſs your love by keeping his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for Chriſt hath promiſed to give his Spirit
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:152821:74"/>unto ſuch, <hi>John</hi> 14.15, 16, 17. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> You are to be earneſt, and conſtant in Prayer for the Spirit, to be given in, to enlighten, and enable you to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very duty <hi>God</hi> calls you to: the gift of the Spirit is, a great gift, and the greateſt next to Chriſt, his Son; too great indeed for us to ask, but not for God to give, for he delights to give, and do great things for his, and not only commands us to ask him, but makes many promiſes to incourage us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28, 29. <hi>Zac.</hi> 12.10; moſt clearly, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If you would have the Spirit, to obey the Spirit in his motions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements within, and without, <hi>Iſa</hi> 30.20, 21. and take heed you do not reſiſt, grieve or quench the Spirit, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63.10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Having obtain'd the Spirit to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and meditate on the means you are to uſe for the preſerving, and increaſing communion with him; as, <hi>Firſt,</hi> To take heed of, and ſhun ſuch ſins, as cauſe him to depart; for inſtance, 1. Take heed of quenching the Spirit, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19. now the Spirit is quenched, as Fire is, either by with-drawing Fuel, or caſting-on of Water, and filth; ſo is the Spirit, when Men either neglect the means, and ſeaſons of grace, or elſe hearken unto, and cheriſh the motions of ſin, and Satan, and the World: hence that Exhortation, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30. To hearken unto the Voice behind us, and not turn to the right hand, or to the left. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take heed of grieving the Holy Spirit of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. Now the Holy Spirit is grieved, as by all ſin, ſo eſpecially by open and ſcandalous ſins, ſuch as lying, diſſembling, idleneſs, rotten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, unbridled paſſion, anger, wrath, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:152821:75"/>as you may ſee clearly, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 25. <hi>to the end. Thirdly,</hi> Take heed of reſiſting the Holy Ghoſt, which is a higher degree of ſinning, when Men and Women, not only refuſe to hearken unto the Voice of the Spirit in the Miniſtry of the Word, but even fall fowl on the Doctrines, and truths, that are taught out of the Word, and quarrel with the Miniſters for their plain, and faithful dealing with them, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did with <hi>Jeremy</hi> 43.1.2. and the <hi>Jews</hi> with <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 5.71. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Take heed of tempting the Holy Ghoſt, as <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.1. <hi>to the</hi> 10. <hi>Q.</hi> When do Men tempt the Holy Ghoſt, to take vengeance on them? <hi>A.</hi> You may ſee in that place, when they will profeſs, and pretend that which is not in them, as faith, and love, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, (which are the moſt eminent fruits of the Spirit) and yet are wholly void of them; when Men will profeſs, and pretend they ſeek the glory of God, the publick good, the weal, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of others, as well as themſelves, and yet do nothing leſs, but ſeek only their own private, Worldly, and fleſhly intereſt, care not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of others, let them ſink or ſwim, all's one to them; and worſe than ſo, to promote their own private intereſt, will be ſtill plotting and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing miſchief againſt others; ſtill inſtilling pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, into the heads, and hearts, and tongues of others, and yet profeſs, and pretend the quite contrary. This lying and diſſembling of Profeſſors is that which tempts the Holy Ghoſt to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on them ſooner, or later, for their audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous robbing Him of thoſe glorious Attributes, of his Omnipreſency, Omniſciency, Omnipotency,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:152821:75"/>and to exemplarily puniſh ſuch as dare to ſin, not only againſt the light of the Word, but the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of the Holy Spirit in their Conſciences. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Take heed of defiling his Temple, for if any Man defile the Temple of God, him will God deſtroy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Q.</hi> Who are they that do ſo?

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The Fourth Head of Meditation, is MAN.</head>
               <p>IN and about Man to meditate on the Four-fold Eſtate of Man, the Four laſt Things or Ends of Man, and ſuch things in the Soul, and in the Body about the Tongue, Talents, Time, and Eternity of Man, as may moſt conduce to the enabling of you to anſwer God, and Chriſt, and the Spirit in all they have done for man: <hi>Firſt,</hi> To meditate on the Four-fold Eſtate of Man: his bleſſed ſtate by Creation, curſed ſtate by Tranſgreſſion, gracious ſtate by Regeneration, and happy eſtate by Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> His bleſſed eſtate by Creation, and here to take notice of, and meditate on theſe things; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he was made the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of all the viſible Creatures: <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he was made in the moſt excellent manner. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That he was made to the moſt excellent ends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He was made the moſt excellent of all the viſible Creatures, as appears, <hi>Firſt,</hi> In reſpect of the ſtructure of his Body, and the endowments of his Soul, of which we ſhall ſpeak hereafter: <hi>Secondly,</hi> In that he was made after his own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in knowledge, righteouſneſs, and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:152821:77"/>
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In that he was made the Habitation, and Temple of the Holy Ghoſt. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In that he was made Lord over all the Creatures, all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected under his Feet, and all for his uſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In that he was made the Epitome, or abridgment of the whole Creation, there being nothing in the World, but there is ſome thing in Man, like unto it: as, touching God, we believe Him to be a Spirit, touching the World, we know it to be a Body; in Man we have an abridgment of both, namely of God, in reſpect of his Spirit, and of the World, in reſpect of his Body. As in the World there are ſome things viſible, and ſome things inviſible, ſo in Man a viſible Body, and an inviſible Soul: as in the World, ſome Creatures live the life of Vegetation, as Plants, ſome the life of Senſe, as Beaſts, ſome the life of Reaſon, as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; in Man you have all theſe kinds of life. In a word, as (one well) Man is God's Text, all the Creatures are Commentaries on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Meditate on the excellent manner of Man's Creation: 1. Whereas all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were made by a bare and ſimple command, God did but ſay the word, <hi>Let there be Light, and there was Light;</hi> and ſo in the reſt: When God made Man, it was not without Divine Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſacred Trinity did not barely ſpeak the Word, <hi>Let there be Man,</hi> but they conſulted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſaying, <hi>Let (<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s) make Man,</hi> Gen. 1.26. Not that God needed it, but to ſhew that He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make Man a more excellent Creature than the reſt. 2. He not only conſulted about the making Man, but He put his hand to it, for he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:152821:77"/>Man of the duſt of the Earth, and <hi>breath'd into him the breath of life,</hi> Gen. 2.7.22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Meditate on the excellent ends where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God made Man, namely to contemplate thoſe glorious Excellencies of his, which ſhine forth in the work of Creation, and ſhew forth to others the glory that is in them, to be quickned by it, to ſerve him in all, and for all, and that he might be for ever happy in communion with Him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him in all, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. <hi>laſt.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 6. <hi>laſt.</hi> The ſerious meditation of theſe things will cauſe us to admire, and adore Him in what he hath done for man, and to ſay with <hi>David, Lord what is man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. <hi>Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and wonderfully am I made, O how precious are the thoughts of thee, Pſal.</hi> 139. This alſo ſhould bequicken Man to ſerve Him cheerfully in all, and for all that ſhould make all for us, and us for himſelf, or elſe will ſhame and confound us, at the laſt, that all his Creatures ſhould ſerve him better by the very inſtinct of nature, than we by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To meditate on the curſed Eſtate of Man, by tranſgreſſion: and here to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on theſe two things, the Cauſes of it, and the Conſequences of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Cauſes of it, and theſe either Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, or Internal: 1. External; and here, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The efficient cauſe the Devil, the Devil having fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len himſelf from God, by his diſobedience, out of enmity againſt God, and envy of Man's happy condition, vehemently deſir'd, and endeavour'd the fall of Man, that ſo he might have the more company both in ſin and puniſhment: whence our
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:152821:78"/>Saviour ſtiles him a Lyar, and a Murderer, from the beginning, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. And <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>He walks up, and down, like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. The <hi>2d.</hi> outward cauſe was Inſtrumental, <hi>viz.</hi> the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Q.</hi> But could a Serpent ſpeak? <hi>A.</hi> It was not the Serpent but the Devil in the Serpent, therefore call'd the old Serpent, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. <hi>Q.</hi> But why did he make uſe of the Serpent, rather than any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>A.</hi> 1. Becauſe of his ſubtilty; the Serpent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſubtil than any other Beaſt of the Field. 2. In reſpect of his activity to move up and down more nimbly, and creep in, and out of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, unſeen of <hi>Adam,</hi> who was the keeper of it. <hi>Q.</hi> But why did not <hi>Eve</hi> fear, and miſtruſt the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and the Devil in it. <hi>A.</hi> 1. ſhe fear'd not then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had no ſin then, and there was no enmity then, between Man and the Creature. 2. She did not miſtruſt any miſchief, becauſe it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable ſhe was ignorant of the fall of the Angels; had ſhe known it, ſhe would have watcht more narrowly againſt him. <hi>Q.</hi> What may we learn here that the Devil made uſe of the Serpent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his ſubtilty? <hi>A.</hi> If there be any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or gift more excellent than other, the Devil will be ſure to make uſe of it, for the doing more miſchief, as he did of the Scribes and Phariſees, and the Rulers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe they were more learned, and honourable, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.48, 49. And therefore the greater any Man's parts and place is, it ſhould be his wiſdom to be the more watchful againſt Satan, and cauſe him to abuſe them, to the diſhonour of God, the wronging of others, and the wounding of his own Soul.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:152821:78"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the internal and principal cauſe of Man's Fall, that was the abuſe of his own free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, becauſe he freely and voluntarily tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and broke God's Commandment in eating the forbidden fruit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. <hi>laſt.</hi> Therefore God no way acceſſary to it, nor could be the Author of it, as ſome wicked ones have thought, and taught: for God uſed all means both before, and in his Creation to prevent it, as in his making him after his own Image, and endowing him with knowledge, and power to do what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, and in that he immediately inſtituted a Sabbath, to put him and keep him in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his dutie to God: therefore every man to juſtifie God, and condemn himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To meditate on the Conſequents of the Fall, which is Sin, and the Curſe. By our firſt Parents diſobeying the command of God, in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the forbidden Fruit, there followed the curſe of God upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and all his Poſterity: and this Curſe, it comprehends under it three things, Guilt, Filth, and Puniſhment; every Son and Daughter of <hi>Adam</hi> came in guilty of that firſt ſin, as you may ſee cleerly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9.19. Eſpecially, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, 17, 18, 19. <hi>Q.</hi> And how ſo? When as they were not then born, Is it Juſtice in God to puniſh all for one Man's offence? <hi>A.</hi> Yes, 1. Becauſe <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin was not peculiar to his Perſon, but common to all Man-kind, <hi>Adam</hi> ſuſtaining the place, not of a private, but a publick Perſon, he was the Father, and Root of all Man-kind, and receiv'd whatſoever good he had, not only for himſelf, but all his Poſterity. Had he ſtood in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, he and his had continued in that bleſſed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:152821:79"/>Eſtate, wherein they were created, but now fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that by his Rebellion, he brought the Curſe upon himſelf, and all his Poſterity. Divines illuſtrate it thus: In Murder, though the hand only kill, yet the whole Man becomes guilty. In a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> what's done by the Knight of the Shire or the Burgeſs of a City, is ſaid to be done by all that made choice of them. When a great Perſon commits Treaſon, he doth not only diſinherit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but his poſterity; the conſideration of this ſhould cauſe every one to take to heart that firſt ſin, and humble himſelf before the Lord under it. That you maybe the more effectually humbled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. 1. To conſider of the greatneſs of that firſt ſin, how-ever it may ſeem a ſmall matter in the eye of carnal reaſon, to eat a little forbidden fruit; yet (as one truly) <hi>Peccare in minimo, pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum non minimum</hi>) To ſin, this did ſo much the more aggravate their ſin, that they would offend ſo great, and good a God, for ſo ſmall a matter, that when God had given them liberty to eat of all other Trees in the Garden, yet they would not deny themſelves in this one: beſides, this firſt ſin is that contains in the bowels of it, may other cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins, as Apoſtaſie, Infidelity, Curioſity, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, Pride, Preſumption, Murder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a word, was the cauſe of all other ſin, and miſery upon the Creature, and of the Damnation of all Souls, that have been, are, or ſhall be damned, and therefore we have every one great and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual cauſe of humbling, and abaſing our ſelves before the Lord under the conſideration of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As there followed guilt, ſo filth, or the defilement of the whole Man with ſin original,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:152821:79"/>and actual, and here to meditate what theſe are, and what ſpecial things in them are to be medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on, for the humbling of our Souls, and the keeping us from cloſing with Temptations to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What ſin is? <hi>viz.</hi> The tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, either revealed in the Word, 1 Ep. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.4. or written in the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. and here about ſin, to take notice, and meditate on the ugly, filthy, hurtful, hateful nature of it: 1. For the ugly nature of ſin, it is not only evil, but the worſt of all evils, and the cauſe of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evils, that it is moſt contrary to God's moſt Holy Nature, that which made the Devil a Devil, and Hell to be Hell, without which the Devil would be a bleſſed Angel, and Hell would be Heaven; that alſo that could not be expiated, and done away by the death, and blood-ſhed of all the Creatures, but only by the precious heart-blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Meditate on the filthy nature of it, as, it is compar'd to the Excrements of Man, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 4.4. and called the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Excrement of Excrements, or ſuperfluity of naughtineſs, <hi>James</hi> 1.21. yea not only filthy in the concrete, but fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs it ſelf in the abſtract, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Q.</hi> But how doth this appear? <hi>A.</hi> In that it defiles a man in all, and all to him: 1. It defiles him in all, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very faculty of Soul, every power of Body, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.19, 20. whence <hi>Solomon</hi> calls the ſinner a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Perſon, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.3. becauſe ſin is that which makes him loathſome to all, to God, and Man, and Himſelf. 1. To God, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.8. my Soul loatheth them. 2. Loathſome to Men, eſpecially
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:152821:80"/>good Men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. <hi>laſt. Iſai.</hi> 66.24. <hi>3dly.</hi> That which makes men loathſome to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when God once opens their Eyes to ſee it, and brings them home to himſelf by Repentance, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. <hi>Job</hi> 42.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it defiles a Man in all, ſo all to him; all his Relations, all his Enjoyments, all his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, natural, civil, religious, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.15. <hi>To the impure, all things are impure,</hi> the Word is a killing Letter, the Sacraments Seal up Damnation; in ſhort, of ſo defiling a nature, as all the Water of the old World, could not waſh away the ſtain of it, nor all the Fire of the laſt Judgment, and of Hell, will be able to burn up the droſs of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Meditate on the hateful nature of ſin, how hateful it is to God, and good men. 1. To God, it is the only object of his hatred, he hates nothing, but as it is ſinful, not the Devil, but only as ſin made him a Devil. 2. That it is ſo hateful to God, appears, in that he hates it where-ever he ſees it. Even in his own Son, who knew no ſin, yet becauſe he took our ſin upon him, he ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted his hatred of it, as he would not ſpare the ſevere puniſhment of it in him; becauſe the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures could not ſtrike a ſtroke hard enough, he was pleas'd to bruiſe him, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.16. and to lay upon him the fierceneſs of his wrath, <hi>Lament.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As hateful to God, ſo to all good men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.21. <hi>Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee, ſearch me, and try me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.128. <hi>I hate every falſe way;</hi> the Martyrs ſo hated ſin, as they choſe rather to burn at the Stake, and undergo any torment, than give way to any ſin; <hi>Anſelm</hi> (Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) was wont to ſay, that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:152821:80"/>if he ſaw Hell on one ſide, and ſin on the other, and he muſt of neceſſity chooſe one; he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chooſe Hell, without ſin: and no wonder, for where there is no Sin, there is no Hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> On the hurtful nature of ſin, this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, 1. In that it is the greateſt Enemy to God, to Chriſt, to the Spirit, to Us: 1. To God, it's that which ſeeks to un-Throne Him, and un-God Him, and there is no true and loyal Subject, but will endeavour the death of him that ſeeks the death of his Soveraign Lord and King. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The greateſt Enemy to Chriſt, that which brought him from Heaven to the Croſs, made Him ſweat Blood, under the apprehenſion of his Father's wrath due to him, and to cry out on the Croſs, to the amazement of Heaven, and Earth, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Thirdly,</hi> The greateſt Enemy to the Spirit of God, that which quencheth, and grieveth, and vexeth, and reſiſts him, makes him to leave his Habitation; and when he goes out, the Devil comes in with ſeven worſe Spirits than ever, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.45. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The greateſt Enemy to Us, that which deprives us of all good, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.2. and expoſeth us to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10. pulls down all manner of Judgments on Perſons, Families, Towns, Cities, Kingdoms, Countreys, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. <hi>laſt. Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. That which makes every man to come in with a Cry, and go out of the World with a Groan: So much of Sin in general.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For Original ſin, that you may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually humbled under it, to take notice of, and meditate on theſe things: 1. What it is: 2. The ſeveral Titles given to it, with the Reaſons of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:152821:81"/>them: 3. The Parts of it: 4 The extent of it: And, 5. The fruits of it: <hi>Firſt,</hi> What it is: for the underſtanding of this, you are to Note, that Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin is taken either actively or paſſively, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Actively, for the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> in eating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, and is call'd by Divines, <hi>Peccatum Originans,</hi> the beginning-ſin, or the ſin giving a beginning to all other ſins. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Paſſively, for the corruption of nature, flowing from that firſt ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and is call'd, <hi>Peccatum Originatum,</hi> or ſin taking a beginning from that firſt ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and this is that which we are to ſpeak unto and may be deſcribed thus, A <hi>privation of Original righteouſneſs, and a depravation of the whole Man with unrighteouſneſs;</hi> Juſtly deriv'd from the loins of our firſt Parents unto all their Poſterity, by reaſon whereof, every Man and Woman is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and born in ſin, brings into the World with them the Seeds of all ſin, is inclin'd to all evil, and averſe to all that is good. 1. There is a depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Original righteouſneſs, wherein Man was created, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10. <hi>There's none righteous, no not one. Secondly,</hi> A depravation of the whole man with unrighteouſneſs, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. The Scripture hath concluded all under ſin, not only <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> all Men but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> all things in man, for the word is in the Neuter Gender: and it is further evident, by the Apoſtle's Prayer, for Univerſal Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. Implying an Univerſal Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſay, juſtly deriv'd from the Loins of our firſt Parents, to all their Poſterity, as you may ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Adam</hi> begot a Son, in his own likeneſs, that is, a ſinner like himſelf, <hi>Job</hi> gives the reaſon, <hi>Job</hi> 14.4. <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:152821:81"/>of an unclean?</hi> and ſo doth our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.18. and <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.11, 12. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I add, [by reaſon whereof every one is conceiv'd &amp; born in ſin] this <hi>David</hi> acknowledgeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.8. The Lord ſtiles <hi>Iſrael</hi> a Tranſgreſſor from the Womb. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He brings in with him the Seeds of all ſin even the vileſt, that ever were conceiv'd, or acted by Men, or Devils, as the Chaos contain'd in it the Seed of all Creatures, ſo the corruption of our nature, the Seeds of all ſin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.19. as in Water, Face anſwers to Face, ſo doth the heart of Man to Man. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Are inclin'd to all evil, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Nitimur invetitum, &amp;c.</hi> as the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then could obſerve and ſay. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I add, [and averſe to all that is good], <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For your further humiliation under it, take notice of the odious Titles given to it with the Reaſons of them: 1. It's call'd Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin: 1. Becauſe it was <hi>ab origine</hi> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Man's Fall: <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe it is <hi>cum origine,</hi> with the beginning of every man. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe it is <hi>Origo,</hi> the Beginning, Root, and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all actual ſin: <hi>Secondly,</hi> It's call'd the ſin that dwells in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17. becauſe it remains in all unto death: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It's call'd the ſin that eaſily encompaſſeth us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. or that ſoon overtakes us, and keep us from running the Race ſet before us: <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It's call'd concupiſcence, or luſt, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14, 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. Becauſe it's the Mother of all unclean luſts, motions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It's call'd the old man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. becauſe it came from the old <hi>Adam. Sixthly,</hi> It's
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:152821:82"/>call'd the Fleſh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. becauſe it acts, and diſcovers it ſelf in, and by the Fleſh. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> It's call'd the Law in the Members, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. becauſe it Rules as a Law. <hi>Eighthly,</hi> It's call'd the work of the Devil, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. And Hell, that ſets on Fire the whole courſe of nature, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.6. becauſe it came from the Devil, and from Hell, and leads to the Devil and, Hell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To Meditate on the parts of it, to wit, an abſence of all good, and a preſence of all evil, an emptineſs of all righteouſneſs, and a fulneſs of all unrighteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That you may be the more throughly humbled, meditate on the extent of it; How doth this corruption of nature, like a Leproſie, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ſpread the whole man, Soul and Body, every faculty and power of both: 1. For the faculties of the Soul, it fills the mind with blindneſs, the will with perverſneſs, the conſcience with deadneſs, the memory with unfaithfulneſs, the heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections with deceitfulneſs and ſenſualneſs, which every one's experience too ſadly evidenceth: <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the parts and powers of the Body, they are all naturally inſtruments of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unholineſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13.19. And all the Senſes, in-lets, and out-lets of ſin, and vanity, 1 Ep. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. So as in the fleſh there dwells no good thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To meditate on the fruits and effects of it, how that by reaſon of it you were conceiv'd and born in ſin, having in your natures the Seed of all ſin, a proneneſs to all evil, and an averſneſs to all good: ſo that you ſee, if you had no other
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:152821:82"/>ſin to bewail, this were enough to humble you all your days, and to make you miſerable to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and therefore to be much in meditation on it, and walk humbly before God, and Man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually under the conſideration of it, and that for theſe Reaſons: 1. Becauſe it is the Mother-ſin, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.19. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe though all actual ſins be repented of, and done away, yet this Root of bitterneſs remains ſtill, and will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it be quite pluckt up by death. 3. Becauſe to bewail actual tranſgreſſions, and not the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature is that which the Lord complains of, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.22. 4. Becauſe a Man is never tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled under his actual ſins, unleſs he bewail alſo his original ſins, ſeeing it is the corruption of nature that inclin'd and carried him into actual ſin: and therefore if you look into the humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God's People, you ſhall find them to bewail, as their actual, ſo their original ſin, as <hi>Job, Job</hi> 40.4. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.5. <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51.5. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.24. and Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> the Martyr, that when he ſaw any break out into any Enormity, would ſmite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Breaſt, and ſay, <hi>Lord, what a wicked heart have I,</hi> and what cauſe have I to give glory to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing grace, that I am not as vile as the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt: and therefore if you would have any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth, and ſoundneſs of your humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation under your actual ſins, be ſure always to take to heart, and bewail original ſin, the Fountain, and rice of all; and to this end remember to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate frequently, and ſeriouſly of what I have briefly open'd to you, in and about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To take notice and meditate on your actual ſins, and that you may be the more thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:152821:83"/>humbled under them, to mind well What it is, the Kinds of it, the multitude, and greatneſs of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What actual ſin is, to wit, Every evil act, or motion ariſing out of the corruption of nature, in thought or affection, word or action, contrary to the revealed will of God in the Word, or the Conſcience; binding over a man to the curſe of the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. <hi>laſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Kinds of it: <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is either by way of Commiſſion, or Omiſſion, when any thing is added to, or taken from the Word; both condemned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.18, 19. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is either of ignorance, or knowledge; both dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, but eſpecially the latter, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.47, 48. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is either a ſin of infirmity, or a reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin: <hi>Firſt,</hi> A ſin of infirmity is ſuch a ſin, as a Man falls into but ſeldom, and beſides his purpoſe, and with reluctance alſo; when he ſees it, doth mourn for it, prays for pardon of it, and power over it, and watcheth more againſt it, <hi>Pſal</hi> 17.3. I have purpoſed my Mouth ſhall not offend. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. The evil which I do, I allow not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> A reigning ſin, is when a Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits any evil, and omits any good, wittingly, or wilfully makes a Trade, or a Cuſtome of it; lives and lies impenitently in it, expreſly forbid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12. The former is the ſin of the regenerate, the latter of the unregenerate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is either pardonable or unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Pardonable ſin is every ſin, even the greateſt that a man is willing to repent of, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.18. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.7, 8. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Unpardonable ſin, is, not only that againſt the Holy Ghoſt, but every ſin,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:152821:83"/>even the leaſt that a man is unwilling to ſee, and to leave, and reſolves to perſiſt impenitently in it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.19. <hi>James</hi> 2.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The degrees of actual ſin, all ſins are not alike, but ſome greater, and ſome leſſer, <hi>Nemo repente fit peſſimus,</hi> none ariſe to the heighth of ſin, but by degrees: and the degrees by which ſin ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to the heighth, are theſe, 1. The thought of it. 2. The pleaſure of it. 3. The conſent to it. 4. The practice of it. 5. The cuſtome of it. 6. Obſtinacy in it. 7. Defence of it. 8. Boaſting of it, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in it. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Deſperate and final impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency in it, which is the perfection of it. If you would be kept from the laſt, not to yield to the firſt; for theſe ſeveral degrees of ſin, they are as ſo many links in a Chain, take hold of one, and you'l draw the reſt after, <hi>James</hi> 1.15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That you may be the more thorowly humbled under your actual ſins, take notice of, and meditate on the multitude of your ſins, both your own Perſonal ſins, and your other Men's ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Your own Perſonal ſins: to this end, take notice what have been your ſins by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, in thought, word, and deed; what have been your ſins, by way of omiſſion in publick, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, ſecret; what have been your ſins of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection before, and in, yea and after duty? What have been the ſins of your Child-hood, Youth, and riper Age? What have been your ſins againſt Law, Goſpel, Word and Rod, Mercies and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, Perſonal, Family, National.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That you may ſee your other Men's ſins, take notice wherein you have been faulty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:152821:84"/>them by way of commiſſion, or omiſſion, as Superiors, Interiours, Equals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That you may be the more throughly humbled, meditate on the greatneſs of your ſins: to this end, Conſider firſt the greatneſs of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, againſt whom every ſin is committed, <hi>viz.</hi> no other than the great God, againſt whom the leaſt offence is greater than the greateſt offence againſt the greateſt Potentates on Earth; He being an infinite God, they but finite Creatures. <hi>Secondly,</hi> A God of infinite Holineſs, who can't look upon any the leaſt ſin, with the leaſt approbation, but infinite deteſtation, <hi>Habback.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A God of infinite goodneſs, from whom we have had beeing, and well-being, Soul, and Body, and what-ever is good for both us, and ours, and all of free and rich grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To conſider the baſeneſs of our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that preſume to ſin, againſt ſo great, ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo gracious a God, no other than poor Worms of the Earth, ſinful duſt and aſhes; vanity, nothing, leſs than nothing, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.17. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The greatneſs of the Price that was paid for the expiating, and taking away of ſin, to wit, no other than the precious blood of Chriſt, the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God, the leaſt drop whereof is of more worth than ten thouſand Worlds, being the Blood of Him, who was God, as well as Man: for ten thouſand Worlds could never have purchaſed the Pardon of the leaſt ſin, being all but finite Creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Conſider the ſmalneſs of the Cauſe moving Men to ſin againſt ſo great and good a God, What is it that moſt Men and Women do
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:152821:84"/>diſhonour God, and damn their Souls for, but a little tranſitory, bitter-ſweet pleaſure? uncertain periſhing profits? fading, vaniſhing breath, and applauſe of men, and therefore it muſt needs be a great offence, to ſin againſt ſo great a God, for ſo ſmall a matter, which makes the Lord himſelf to complain of it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Conſider the Circumſtances in, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the acting of your ſin, as the time, place, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Perſon: for theſe circumſtances exceedingly aggravate ſin; as for Example, when ſuch a ſin is acted by a publick Perſon, or in a publick place, to the ſcandal of others, and the diſgrace of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, not only of ignorance, but knowledge; of weakneſs, but wilfulneſs; not only once, or twice, but often, and that againſt many vows, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to the contrary, notwithſtanding Word, Rod, Mercies, and Judgments, and all the ways, and Means, and Methods God hath uſed to the contrary, to reclaim and bring home poor wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinners to himſelf, and ſave them from ſelf-deſtruction. A ſerious Meditation on theſe things will be an effectual means, through the bleſſing of God, to break the heart for ſin, break off the heart from the love, and liking of all ſin.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> Conſequence of Man's Fall to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, and meditated on for our more thorow humiliation, before the Lord, is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and miſery that fell upon man, and all his Poſterity, by reaſon of that firſt Rebellion of man. And this Puniſhment is double, <hi>Privative</hi> and <hi>Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: Firſt,</hi> For the Privative puniſhment of man's ſin, or the puniſhment of Loſs it conſiſts in theſe Particulars. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The loſs of God's favour
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:152821:85"/>(which he enjoyed in a perfect manner by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) ſo, as now, every one comes into the World, <hi>a Childe of wrath,</hi> Eph. 2.3. an Enemy to God, and God to him; both his Perſon, and all his actions abominable to God. 1. His Perſon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8. 2. His Actions, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>Titus</hi> 1.15. <hi>To the impure all things are impure;</hi> the Reaſon is, 1. Becauſe the Tree muſt be good before the Fruit can, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.18. the Perſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted before the work can. 2. Becauſe the works of natural, carnal Men, are not done by them in a right manner, as knowledg, faith, and love, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which God regards them not, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.2. <hi>Heb</hi> 11.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8. None are done to a right end, <hi>viz.</hi> the glory of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. and therefore both their Perſons and ſervices abhor'd and rejected of God, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As Man, by his Fall, loſt the favour of God, ſo communion and fellowſhip with God, which he enjoyed in a glorious manner, before the Fall; but ſince the Fall, Men are without God in the World, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. and are eſtranged from the life of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Man by his Fall depriv'd himſelf of the Image of God, in which he was created, and contracted on himſelf, and his Poſterity, the Image of ſin, and Satan, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By his Fall, he came ſhort of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God: had Man continued in obedience, it is more than probable, that he ſhould have been tranſlated from a terreſtrial, to a coeleſtial Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, but by his Rebellion, he outed himſelf and his, of both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Man by his Fall loſt his Native dignity:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:152821:85"/>by Creation, he was made little lower than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. but by his Fall he was degraded, and made lower than the Beaſts that periſhed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. <hi>laſt.</hi> For, 1. By this he loſt his honourable title, as he the Child of God, ſo we the Sons and Daughters of the ever living God, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 56. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. preſently after the Fall, ſtiled <hi>Children of Men, Pſal.</hi> 90.3. <hi>Children of the World, Luke</hi> 16.9. <hi>Children of Wrath, Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Coloſſ.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Children of the Devil, Joh.</hi> 8 44. <hi>Children of Hell, Mat.</hi> 20.25. 2. They loſt that glory, luſtre, and beauty, they had by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in Soul and Body, as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.23. <hi>Jude</hi> 23 <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.5, 6. 3. They loſt that great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence they had over the Creatures; he that was Superiour to all, was made inferiour to all, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.20. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.7. The Prophet puts them to School to all, to learn of the Creatures: 4. As Man loſt his preheminence, ſo his authority over all, he that was Lord over all, became a Slave to all, who, inſtead of ſerving Man, rebels againſt Man, labours to pick out his Eys, <hi>Pro.</hi> 30.17. to eat his Fleſh, and lap up his Blood, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.36.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Man loſt his liberty, by Creation he was a free Denizen, and Citizen of the World, all at his command; but preſently after the Fall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Slave, and was in Bondage to all, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the World, and the Fleſh: 1.

The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, what it is, and wherein it conſiſts. 3. The differences of true grace, from falſe grace, from reſtraining grace. 4. Degrees of true ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace. 5. The ſigns of it. 6. The priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of ſuch as have it. 7. The motives to it. 8. The means for the maintaining, encreaſing, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the free unſearchable love and grace of God to his, in not leaving his Elect in their fallen curſed condition, but in his appointed time, effectually calling all ſuch as belong unto his Election of grace, out of a ſtate of nature, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtate of grace. God might have for ever paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by fallen Man-kind, as well as he did the fallen Angels: though he lookt in mercy upon ſome, he might have paſſed by us, amongſt others of fallen Man-kind; and therefore that God ſhould paſs by others, more noble for birth, and it may be more ſober, and civil for converſation, and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, wallowing and weltring in our blood, and filthineſs, and ſay unto us, Live, this ſhould exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly affect our hearts, and make us ſtill to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring, and adoring the free, rich, and unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able love, grace, and mercy of God to us in Chriſt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That we may do this with more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and comfort, to take notice, what this ſtate of grace is: and for the underſtanding of this to know there is a double grace, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the firſt and the ſecond grace; the firſt, whereby our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:152821:88"/>are accepted; the ſecond, whereby they are ſanctified; the firſt, is no other than the free love, and favour of God, whereby he accepts us in Chriſt, and for his ſake forgives all our ſins, and gives us his Spirit, to renew and ſanctifie our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8, 9. The ſecond grace is no other than a ſpecial gift of that grace, and favour of God, otherwiſe call'd in the Scripture Regeneration, <hi>John</hi> 3.6. and Renovation of the Image of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. and Sanctification of the whole Man, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. and the Divine Nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. Godlineſs and holineſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. And it may be deſcribed thus, a work of the Spirit in the Miniſtry of the Word, deriving from Chriſt their head, unto all his Elect, ſpiritual life, grace, or holineſs, and diffuſing it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Man, whereby they are enabled to act and move God-ward, Grace-ward, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-ward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To take notice of, and meditate on the differences of true grace from falſe grace; for <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.14. the Apoſtle ſpeaks of true holineſs, in oppoſition to falſe, and feigned: now theſe differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are eſpecially in three things; as firſt, true ſanctifying grace is from an inward principle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed by the Spirit of Grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. but that in the Hypocrite, is only from an outward principle, as ſhame of the World, fear of puniſhment, and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> True grace makes Men to approve all their thoughts, and words, and ways, to God's all-ſeeing eye, <hi>Job</hi> 31.4. <hi>Job</hi> 42.4, 5. <hi>John</hi> 11.17. A Hypocrite dares not do ſo, he approves them only
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:152821:88"/>to the eyes of men; ſo long as Men think well of him, he cares not what God thinks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> True grace makes Men humble, the more knowledge they have, the more they ſee, and bewail their ignorance, as that wiſe Man, <hi>Pro.</hi> 30.2. I am more brutiſh than any Man, and I have not the underſtanding of a man, <hi>viz.</hi> in compariſon of what he ought to know of God; the more faith he has, the more he bewails his unbelief, as the Father of the poſſeſſed Child, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.24. The more love he hath, the more he bewails his want of love, and calls upon his Soul to love God more, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. But now a Hypocrite he is proud of the grace he hath, and thinks he has more than he hath, and that both God, and man ſhould reſpect him the better, as the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> Luk. 18. <hi>I thank God I am not as this Publican,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Q.</hi> But wherein doth renewing Grace, differ from reſtraining Grace? <hi>A.</hi> Eſpecially in two things: 1. Reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, only keeps Men from the acts of ſin, but doth not mortifie ſin. <hi>Abimeleck</hi>'s luſt was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, when God with held him from <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 20.6. but not mortified; whereas, where there is renewing Grace, ſin is ſubdued, as well as reſtrained, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Reſtraining grace, keeps men from ſinning, out of a ſervile fear of puniſhment; but renewing grace makes men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, out of a fillial fear of offending, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Reſtraining grace keeps men from ſinning, no longer than they are under the means of reſtraint, as godly Magiſtrates, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Parents, Maſters; when they are dead, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, then they can neglect the Worſhip of God, and be as vile as the vileſt: when there was no <hi>King</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:152821:89"/>in <hi>Iſrael, every one did what was good in his own eyes,</hi> Judg. 17.6.18. but renewing grace, where it is, it makes, and keeps men, ever the ſame; and the worſe the times are, the better are they, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To take notice, and meditate on the degrees of grace, all have not the ſame meaſures and degrees of grace, but ſome more, and ſome leſs, whence we read of ſome ſtrong men in Chriſt, others weak, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.1. Some Babes in Chriſt, and others grown Chriſtians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1. Some Trees of righteouſneſs, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.3. Others bruiſed Reeds, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.20. and God hath wiſe and holy ends in this; as, 1. To put a difference between Heaven, and Earth: here we are but renewed, and ſanctified in part (how-ever it be in every part) but in Heaven, <hi>the Spirits of juſt Men are made perfect,</hi> Heb. 12.23. Grace there is perfected in glory, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Secondly,</hi> God will have it ſo, to teach us to live in a continual dependance on that fulneſs there is in Chriſt for us, that we may ſtill go to him, and receive from him grace for grace, <hi>John</hi> 1.16. that is one degree and meaſure after another. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That he may diſplay his glorious Attributes, as his infinite wiſdome, All-mighty Power, unchangeable grace, in carrying on the work of grace, until he hath crown'd grace in glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 10. <hi>Q.</hi> But ſeeing there are different degrees of grace, ſome have more, and ſome leſs, How may a Man know that he hath any truth of grace? even the leaſt degree of ſaving grace? <hi>A.</hi> You may know it by theſe two things; 1. A continual complaint of the want of grace, and the weakneſs of grace, in compariſon of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:152821:89"/>ſtrength of corruption, as the Father of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed Child, this is made by our Saviour the Sign of truth of grace, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in Spirit:</hi> that is, who are ſpiritually poor in their own ſight, and ſenſe. 2. You may know it by earneſt deſires, and endeavours after more grace, as in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 1.11. and the Church, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26.8. Chriſt pronounceth them bleſſed, <hi>that hunger, and thirſt after righteouſneſs,</hi> and promiſeth they ſhall be filled, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Q.</hi> But how ſhall we know our deſires after grace, to be true deſires? <hi>A.</hi> Briefly thus, 1. If they be induſtrious in the uſe of the means, and all means, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If they be fervent deſires, like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1. more after ſpirituals, than tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If they be reſtleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, until we obtain, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.20. <hi>My Soul brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for the longing it hath to thy judgments at all times:</hi> Thus of the evidences of grace in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Now,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take notice of the evidences of ſome particular graces, as knowledge, faith, repentance, obedience, love, fear, and hope: but here before I ſpeak unto them, take this caution, he that hath one of theſe graces in truth, hath ſeminally all, and every ſanctifying grace; how-ever he do not ſee it; as he that hath one link of a Chain, hath the whole Chain; ſo he that hath one ſaving, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying grace in truth, hath all: what is ſaid of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal ſin <hi>(una eſſentiâ, ſed multiplex efficientiâ)</hi> is true alſo of ſanctifying grace, though but one in it ſelf, yet it is vertually all. I ſhall give you only three evidences of each; ſuch as deſire more, may ſee them in other Books, where they are fully hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:152821:90"/>
               <p n="1">1. For the truth of ſanctifyed knowledge, it is thus evidenced, it is experimental, practical, and humble: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Experimental, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Practical, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. <hi>laſt. Thirdly,</hi> Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the truth of ſanctifying faith, it is thus evidenced, it is a ſelf-emptying, working, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting faith; 1. It is a ſelf-emptying, or ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying faith, it makes a Soul to deny his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in point of Juſtification, and acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with the Apoſtle deſires to be found only in Chriſt's righteouſneſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. to diſclaim alſo his own ability, for any thing that is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally good; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. and to enter upon duty, only in the Name and Strength of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is a working faith, that which works by love to God, and unto others, for God's ſake, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. It is ſtill working-out corruption; <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. and working-in grace, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is a conquering faith, that which ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles a Soul to with-ſtand, and over-come tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from within, and without, 1 Ep. <hi>John</hi> 5.4. <hi>This is the victory that covercomes the World, even our faith: Q.</hi> What's meant here by World? <hi>A.</hi> Partly the Men of it, that lye in wickedneſs, 1 Ep. <hi>John</hi> 5, 19. and partly the luſts of the World, as the honours, riches, and pleaſures of it, 1 Ep. <hi>John</hi> 2.16. ſo victorious, as it enables them to hold faſt their confidence to the end, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.19. and makes them more than Conquerors over all their ſpiritual Enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. For the truth of repentance, that is eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thus; It is a univerſal, ſincere, and continued repentance: 1. It is univerſal for all, and every

Let not the Sun go down on your wrath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The truth of obedience, evidenced thus. 1. It is univerſal without partiality, <hi>John</hi> 15.14. 2dly. Sincere without hypocriſie, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. 3dly. Conſtant without Apoſtacy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The truth of your love thus evidenced. 1. It is ſpiritual for Grace ſake, and the Truths ſake, 2 <hi>John</hi> 2. to the Elect Lady, whom I love in truth, and for the Truths ſake. 2. It's impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, to one Saint as well as another, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.4. 3. It's permanent, and abiding unto death, like <hi>Ruths</hi> to <hi>Naomi;</hi> the ground of it is Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable love to his, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The truth of your fear of God, thus evidenced. 1. If you fear to ſin, rather then to ſuffer, fear the diſpleaſure of God, more than the diſpleaſure of Man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.4, 5. 2. If you fear him for his Mercy, as well as his Juſtice; his Goodneſs, as well as his Greatneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> 3. If you fear to ſin againſt him in ſecret, where there is no eye to obſerve you, but only Gods, as <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 39.9. and <hi>Job</hi> 31.1, 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The truth of your hope in God, thus evidenced. 1. If it be grounded on the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. 2. If it purifie the Heart, and ſanctifie the Life, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. 3. If it cauſe you patiently to wait on God, for the fulfilling his promiſe, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. If now you would know,

               <p n="1">1. There is an abſolute neceſſity of it. 1. In reſpect of the Decree of God, becauſe he prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated his to Grace before Glory, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the image of his Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. in Grace here, and in Glory hereafter, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. 2dly. In reſpect of the revealed Will of God, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.7. This is the Will of God, even your Sanctification. 3dly, A neceſſity of it, in reſpect of your Salvation, for without Regeneration, no Salvation, <hi>John</hi> 3.6. without Holineſs, no Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There's a tranſcendent excellency in it, for Grace is no other then the Off-ſpring of God, a beam of the Divine Majeſty, <hi>John</hi> 1.13. a ſpark of the Divine Nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. that which is called elſewhere the Name of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. the Seed of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. the Will of God, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.3. the Image of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. the Life of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. the Glory of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.11. becauſe God ſees more
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:152821:91"/>of himſelf in a gracious Soul, and more of his own Glory, in the pooreſt Saint, then in all the glory of the World, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. <hi>begin.</hi> 2. Becauſe it's that which puts a luſtre on all other things, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Wealth, Birth, Beauty, Gifts, Parts, all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grace, is but as a Jewel in a Swines ſnout, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiderings on a Fools Coat; whereas a little true ſanctifying Grace, honours the pooreſt in the eyes of God, of Angels, and Saints, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. All my delight is in the Saints.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider the great Utility and Benefit that comes by Grace. 1. It will intereſt you in all the Promiſes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. Godlineſs is profitable for all things, it hath the promiſe of this Life, and that to come. 2. It will fortifie you againſt all the temptations of Satan to unbelief. Doth the Devil tempt you to diſtruſt Gods love to you, and your right to Heaven, charge you with Hypocriſie? why, pull out the evidences you have of a Work of Grace, and let him ſhew (if he can) if ever any wicked man, or Hypocrite, had ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences; the Devil may ſooner prove himſelf a Lyar, then a Saint to be a Hypocrite. 3. It will bring you contentment, and make you a gainer in and by every condition, as it did the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6. 4. It will ſweeten and ſanctifie every eſtate and condition to you, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, Adverſity, Health, Sickneſs, Life, Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. 5. It will ſupport, chear and comfort you in every eſtate, both of Life and Death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. 6. It will not only accompany you to the Grave, where all other things leave you, but to the Tribunal of Chriſt, and never leave you, until it hath crown'd you with Glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4.</p>

                  </gap>ſe, to get out of a ſtate of Nature, into a ſtate of Grace: What are they? Mark a few. 1. You muſt be willing to ſee, and be ſenſible of, and humbled under your want of Grace, as they, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. and the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.30. 2. You muſt labour to be united unto Chriſt, the Fountain of Spiritual Life and Grace, for the Son quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth whom he will, <hi>John</hi> 5.21. and <hi>John</hi> 1.16. from his fulneſs we receive Grace for Grace; and 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.12.

You muſt go to the Covenant for it, and beg the Lord to remember his Covenant, and glorifie his Grace, in giving in that Grace to you which he promiſeth in the Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. and tells him this Grace is, as free for you as for others, and will be as glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious on you, as on others; and you ſhall give him the glory of it here, and to all eternity.

You muſt wait conſtantly on the Miniſtry of the Word, which is the only ordinary means of getting it, <hi>James</hi> 1.21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. when ever you come to hear the Word, remember to beg the Spirit of God to quicken his Word, that it may quicken your dead Souls, whereby you may be enabled to ſtand up from the dead, and act as new Creatures in a ſtate of Regeneration, to God, and for God; It is the Spirit alone that quickens, <hi>John</hi> 16. and him that God hath promiſed to ſuch as ask him,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:152821:92"/>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 11. And therefore I ſay, ſtill remember to beg the Spirit of God, and wait upon him in the miniſtry of the Word, till he come to breath into this Spirit, Life, a Life of Grace, that may fit you for, and entitle you to, a Life of Glory, to quicken and encourage you.</p>
               <p>Sect. 4. <hi>Take notice of the happy eſtate of Man by Glorification;</hi> and what thoſe things are you are to meditate on, in, and about that, are theſe: 1. What this Glory is, and wherein it conſiſts. 2. The Properties of it. 3. The certainty of it. 4. Who they are that ſhall partake of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What this glory is? In the general, it is no other then the luſtre or beauty of a perſon, or thing that draws admiration after it, and it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther External, Internal, or Eternal. 1. Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, is that ſtate and pomp men have in the World, and drawes the eyes of others after it; of which you may read <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.13. <hi>You ſhall ſhew my Father of my glory in Egypt;</hi> that is, of the pomp, ſtate, and honour I am exalted to. 2. Internal Glory, is that within, in the Soul, in the excellent Gifts and Graces that it is endowed withal, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. The Kings Daughter is all glorious within; and <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.27. where God ſaid to <hi>Moſes,</hi> He ſhould bring <hi>Joſhua</hi> before the Prieſt, and put ſome of his Glory and Spirit upon him. 3. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Glory, Is that which he promiſeth to his in this life. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.4. The reward of humility, and the fear of the Lord, is Riches and Glory. 4. Eternal Glory, Is that which God will confer upon the Saints in Heaven: If you ask what that is? we muſt anſwer in the words of <hi>Auſtin, Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius eſt excogitare, quid non ſit, quam quid ſit:</hi> It
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:152821:93"/>cannot be conceived, much leſs expreſſed, yet as they gueſſed at the fruitfulneſs of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> by the mighty cluſters of Grapes they brought thence; ſo may we at the glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by that glymps the Scripture holds forth of it. That you may have the clearer ſight of it, we will conſider it comparatively, with that which is in the World, and then abſolutely as it is in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> If we compare it with that glory, which is viſible in the World, we may gueſs ſomewhat at the tranſcendent excellency of it. You may ſee abundance of glory in all the Works of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in thoſe Celeſtial Bodies above, the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars: but alas, what is this to the Glory of Heaven? And</p>
               <q>
                  <l>If in Heav'ns outward Court ſuch glory be;</l>
                  <l>What is the Glory which the Saints do ſee?</l>

               </q>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider it abſolutely in it ſelf. And here take notice of the Glorious Place, and Glorious Company, and Glorious Endowments of Soul and Body; the Glorious Employments of both, and the Glorious Priviledges the Saints ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy there.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Glotious Place; that is, the higheſt Heaven, that which the Apoſtle calls the <hi>Third Heaven,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and this place is, <hi>Verus &amp; totus Olimgus,</hi> wholly Light, not only beſpangled here and there with glittering Stars, but as one great Sun, and that which is increaſed by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ſplendor of the glorified Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and thoſe millions of glorified Saints,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:152821:93"/>whoſe Bodies there ſhall ſhine, not onely as the Stars, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. but as the Sun, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.43.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Glorious Company. There you ſhall have the ſociety not only of all your Chriſtian Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, Friends and Acquaintance, that have liv'd and dyed in the Lord, but of all the Holy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, Saints; not only of the Glorious Angels, but the ever bleſſed Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: and if the company of a few humble, upright, chearful Chriſtians be ſo ſweet here, how ſweet muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion be with all theſe?</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the Glorious Endowments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the Soul. As ſoon as the Soul is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Body, it goes to the Spirits of juſt men made perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. It is perfected in all its Faculties, Underſtanding, Will, Memory, Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. 1. For the Underſtanding; It is perfected in the knowledge of God, and all that's good, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10, 11, 12. Here we are but as in the <hi>Grammer School,</hi> there we ſhall be in the <hi>Univerſity;</hi> here the knowledge moſt have, is but the leaſt part of that they ſhall know there, of God and the Creatures, of the Myſteries of Religion, and the Secrets of Nature. 2. For the Will; there ſhall be in it a perfect conformity to the Will of God, we ſhall will all that is good, and that more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with more alacrity, then here we ever wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led any pleaſure of this life. 3. For the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; It ſhall be ſo perfected, as to remember all that is good, and nothing that is evil, ſo as to be troubled for it, but rejoyce rather in this, that we are freed from it. 4. For the Affections; Theſe ſhall be wholly taken up with, and reſt upon
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:152821:94"/>God, and all that is good, the meaſure of our love, and delight in him, ſhall be to love and delight in him without meaſure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the glory of the Body, you may reade it 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42, 43. 1. It ſhall be an incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible body, freed from all poſſibility of dying and ſuffering, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.35. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.16. 2. It ſhall be full of beauty, ſhining not onely as the Stars, but as the Sun, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.41. made like to Chriſts glorious Body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> 3. It ſhall be a moſt vigorous Body, able to do any thing. <hi>Etiamſi ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit, terram movere,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Anſelm</hi>) able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter legions of Devils and Reprobates, by the almighty power of God dwelling in it. 4. A Spiritual Body; Not that it ſhall be turned into a Spirit, but endowed with ſuch ſpiritual qualities, as it ſhall be agile, active, and nimble in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, like a Spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To meditate on the glorious employments of Soul and Body, both ſhall be continually exerciſed in the higheſt ſervices, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſinging of the Songs of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Lamb, the ſinging of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> to God our Father, for Chriſt our Redeemer, by the ever bleſſed Spirit our San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifier and Comforter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To meditate on the glorious priviledges of Soul and Body there, which are either Primitive or Poſitive.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Primitive, in a freedom of all evil, both of Sin and Puniſhment. 1. Of Sin, not only from the power of it, but the very being of it; not only from ſin, but from all temptations to it, and occaſions of it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. <hi>laſt.</hi> 2. Of puniſhment, <hi>Bevel.</hi> 21.4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.3. tryumphing over all,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:152821:94"/>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. <hi>O death, where is thy ſting?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Poſitive priviledges, they are theſe, 1. The continual preſence of God, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. <hi>laſt.</hi> there we ſhall ever be with the Lord. 2. The beatifical Viſion of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. <hi>O beata viſio, videre Deum in nobis, nos in Deo, &amp; Deum in ſe ipſo,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bernard</hi>) What a bleſſed ſight will this be, to ſee God in us, our ſelves in God, and God in himſelf, ſo far as our finite natures are capable of. 3. The neareſt Union that can be, not only of a Gracious, but a Glorious. 4. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, perfect, and everlaſting communion with God, where there will be no need of Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Ordinances, but God will be all in all, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.21, 22. 5. Perfection of Holineſs both in Nature and Life, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.23. Pure, as he is pure, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. And Perfect, as he is perfect, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>laſt.</hi> Not onely in parts, but in degrees. 6. Fulneſs of Joy, and Rivers of Pleaſure, which are at Gods right hand for evermore, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>laſt.</hi> 7. An everlaſting Sabbath; here we have but a weekly Sabbath, there an eternal everlaſting Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; here we keep a Sabbath with much weati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there we ſhall keep it with infinite delight, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.9. There remains a reſt for the People of God, and this is a tranſcendent Reſt, an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Reſt, an univerſal Reſt, a perpetual Reſt, where we ſhall reſt from all ſinning, ſorrowing, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and with the whole <hi>Quire</hi> of Heaven ſhall be ſtill ſinging <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> to God the Father, for God the Son, by God the Spirit, to all Eternity, and ſtill following the Lamb, with Crowns on our Heads, and Palmes in our Hands, and tryumphant Songs in our Mouths.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:152821:95"/>
               <p n="2">2. Meditate on the properties of this Glory. 1. It's a revealed Glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. Here it is hid from the eyes of the World, and often from the eyes of Chriſtians themſelves; but there it ſhall be revealed, at the laſt day, before all the World, and the wicked World be made to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, to their ſhame, and confuſion of face, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3, 4. 2. A full Glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>laſt.</hi> ſo full as the Apoſtle is not able to expreſs it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. ſo full of Glory, that if the Saints themſelves were not upheld by the almighty power of God, they could not ſtand under it; ſo full of glory, that becauſe it cannot enter into them, they ſhall enter into it; Well done good and faithful Servant, enter into thy Maſters joy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 3ly, An eternal glory, ſuch as they ſhall not only enjoy for millions of years, but to all eternity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>laſt.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To meditate on the certainty of this Glory. That it is moſt certain, there is ſuch a glorious ſtate for the People of God, is evident upon theſe infallible grounds. 1. Becauſe it was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for them from before the foundation of the World, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. 2. Becauſe they are prepared for it, they are ſaid to be Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels prepared unto Glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23. 3. Becauſe God predeſtinated his unto it, from all eternity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13, 14. 4. That which they are called unto, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. 5. That which Chriſt hath purchaſed with his precious Blood, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9, 10. 6. That which he made interceſſion for whilſt he was here upon earth, <hi>John</hi> 17.24. and ſtill doth now in Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. 7. That which he hath made
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:152821:95"/>many promiſes of, and ſeconded them with his Oath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18. 8. He hath given his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as the earneſt of it. 9. He hath given the beginnings of it in Grace here, which is but glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry begun. 10thly, and laſtly, He is gone into Heaven to take poſſeſſion of it in our Name and Nature, and hath promiſed he will come again, and take us to himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 14.3. and accounts not himſelf fully glorified, until his Body, and every member of it, be in the ſame glory, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. <hi>the end.</hi> And,</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Conſider who they are that have a right and title to this Glory, what evidences the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture holds forth of it; As, 1. an effectual Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. 2. Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. 3. Sanctification, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.28. More particularly the having and exerciſing theſe Graces; 1.

               <head>The Second Head of Meditation about Man, is the four laſt Things or Ends of Man, <hi>DEATH, JUDGEMENT, HELL</hi> and <hi>HEAVEN.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE are to meditate on every one of theſe, and that on theſe grounds; 1. On <hi>Death;</hi> becauſe Death were no Death, if Judgment did not follow in compariſon; and Judgement no Judgment, or nothing ſo dreadful, if Hell did not follow; and Hell no Hell in compariſon, if it did not deprive men of Heaven. 2. Therefore to meditate on theſe laſt Ends of Man, becauſe it is the Lord himſelf adviſeth his unto, and that in a very pathetical manner, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.29. Oh that men were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they conſidered their latter end; and the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah,</hi> (Jer. 5. <hi>laſt.</hi>) he puts this queſtion, <hi>What will you do in the latter end?</hi> He would have them know there is an end, and to think ſeriouſly what will become of them in the end. 3. Therefore to meditate on each of theſe; as 1. on <hi>Death,</hi> becauſe it will be a notable means, 1. to make us apply our hearts unto Spiritual Wiſdom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.12. 2. To reſtrain us from ſin, leſt Death ſhould find us in it, or preſently after it; As a Copy of Writing is ſafeſt from blotting, when duſt is caſt on it, ſo we are ſafeſt from ſinning, when we remember that we are but Duſt, <hi>(Callamy).</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:152821:96"/>3. A notable means to quicken us to repentance; an inſtance you have in <hi>Waldus,</hi> A rich Merchant of <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who ſeeing one drop down dead in the ſtreets, went home, repented, and changed his life, ſtudied the Scriptures, became a Teacher and Father of thoſe Chriſtians called the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> or the poor Men of <hi>Lyons.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To meditate on the great and terrible day of Judgment, becauſe it will be as a curb to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain from ſinning, ſo a ſpur to quicken to duty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.9.10, 11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore to meditate on <hi>Hell,</hi> becauſe it will be a notable means to keep us out of Hell; whence one adviſeth thus, <hi>Deſcendamus viventes, ut non deſcendamus morientes, (Bernard.)</hi> Let us of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten look down into it, that we may never fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore to meditate on <hi>Heaven,</hi> becauſe it will make us more willing to leave Earth to go to Heaven, whenſoever God calls for us; the reaſon why ſo few go to Heaven when they die, is, becauſe they never thought of Heaven, until they came to die, <hi>(Calamy.)</hi>

The original procreant cauſe of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Sin; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. laſt. <hi>The wages of ſin is death,</hi> therefore as often as you are tempted to ſin by the preſent credit, profit, and pleaſure of it, to think on the fruit of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21. <hi>What fruit had you in thoſe things, whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> 3. On the certainty of it: In the day that thou eateſt of it, in dying thou ſhalt die, that is, thou ſhalt moſt certainly die, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. It's appointed for all to die. 4. The uncertainty of it; as nothing more certain, ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more uncertain, <hi>(Ut morior ſcio, ſed neſcio, ubi, quomodo, quando.)</hi> That I ſhall die, I know, but where, how, and when, I know not: It's a Proverb, <hi>When Health is higheſt, Death is many times nigheſt;</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.3. <hi>When men cry peace, then comes ſudden deſtruction.</hi> To day the Sermon-Bell tolls to call you to Church, to morrow it may be the Paſſing-Bell to ſummon you to the Grave; and therfore to wait for it, at all times, and in all places, in all manner of wayes, becauſe all things come alike to all, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.1. 5. To conſider to die, is but once to be done; and that which is but once to be done, had need to be well done, or we are for ever undone; if this work be not done, or but half done, at the time of dying there's no doing or finiſhing it afterwards, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10. As the Tree falleth, ſo it lyeth; as Death leaves men, ſo Judgment finds them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. 6. To meditate on the terribleneſs of Death, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the King of Terrors, <hi>Job</hi> 18.14. and needs muſt, ſeeing it ſeparates thoſe two friends, Soul and Body, delivers up the Soul immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſtand forth before the Tribunal of Chriſt, to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:152821:97"/>receive his peculiar Sentence of Damnation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgment Day comes; and after the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, to be carried by the Devils into Hell, and throwes the body of the wicked into the Grave, where Death gnaws upon it, as upon Carrion in a Ditch; puts an end to all his temporal felicity, and begins his eternal miſery; ſtrips him of all the comforts of this life, and brings him to eternal torments.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To meditate on the means you are to uſe to uſe to fit you for Death, and they are, amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, theſe; 1. To acquaint your ſelves with God, and make your peace with him by Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>Eliphas</hi> counſels <hi>Job, Job</hi> 21.22. 2. To get and clear up your intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, who hath deſtroyed Death, and him that had the power of Death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. 3. To pull out the ſting of Death, by Faith in the Blood of Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for every known ſin, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. to ſee that Sin die ere you die, for it's one of the terribleſt threatnings in the Book of God, <hi>John</hi> 8.21. If you believe not that I am <hi>He,</hi> you ſhall die in your ſins; and <hi>Luke</hi> 13. Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Antequam moriaris moriantur in te vitia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou dyeſt, be careful to ſee that ſin die. 4. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to die daily, as unto ſin, ſo unto the World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29. The time is but ſhort, and the faſhion of this World paſſeth away; it's the worſt huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry in the World, to have Grace to ſeek when men ſhould make uſe of it, and the ſick Bed is the worſt time of all others to ſeek it in, being then ſcarce able to think on any thing, but Pain, and Death, and Hell. 5. To get and clear up a Work
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:152821:98"/>of Grace, that may entitle you to Glory, or there will be nothing elſe able to ſtand by you, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort you; all things in the World, without a Work of Grace, will, (like <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends) prove miſerable Comforters. 3 <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>Except a man be born again,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Fleſh and Blood ſhall never inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 6. Not only look to this, that you have Grace, but that you keep it in exerciſe; not only, that you have Lamps, and Oyl in them, but that you trim them againſt your Lord's coming, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. that is, that you act and exerciſe your Graces, eſpecially theſe, your Faith, and Patience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. your heavenly-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and contempt of the World, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. 7. That you get and keep good Conſciences, this will be light in darkneſs, and life in death, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.32. The Righteous hath hope in his death. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. This is our rejoycing in the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Conſciences, <hi>&amp;c. Iſa.</hi> 38.2. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how I have walkt before thee in Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Laſtly, It was <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Prayer, and let it be yours daily, <hi>Teach us, Lord, ſo to number our dayes, as we may apply our hearts unto Wiſdom,</hi> Pſal. 90. In a word, Let the ends of all your thoughts be, the thought of your latter end, that ſo when you come to die, you may have nothing elſe left to do, but to die; and whenſoever Death comes, you may bid it wellcome in the Name of Chriſt; and when you are to die, to die in charity with all, in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God's Call, and in Faith to go to, and be for ever with the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To meditate on ſuch things, as may not only fit and prepare you for death, but medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on ſuch things as may make you willing to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:152821:98"/>die, and help you to die comfortably; What are they? Mind here well, for they are of ſpecial uſe to you; As firſt,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The certainty of another, and a better life, after this, nothing ſo ſure, as that by what you have ſeen already by the teſtimony of Scripture, and many weighty grounds of it, in your medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the Life of Glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Meditate on the evidences you have of an intereſt in that better Life of Glory, as your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God, in Chriſt, in the Spirit, and in the Graces of the Spirit, as your effectual Vocation, Juſtification, Adoption, Sanctification, and thoſe Graces unto which 'tis promiſed, as Saving, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Knowledge, Faith, Repentance, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; love to the Saints, the Truth; ſincerity and uprightneſs of your heart, in all, to which you may ſee it frequently promiſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. to the end, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To meditate on the many and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty grounds God hath given to encourage your Faith, and ſtrengthen your Patience, and cauſe both to have their perfect work.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To encourage your Faith: as 1. his immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table decree, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. 2. His unchangeable Love, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. 3. His everlaſting Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39. 4. His continual Interceſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. 5. His almighty Power to keep them through Faith unto Salvation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we ſhould let go our Faith, yet he will hold it faſt by his Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The grounds to ſtrengthen our Patience: 1. It's a Lord, whoſe Will cannot be reſiſted; a Father, who ought readily to be obeyed; a wiſe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:152821:99"/>Father, who knows what is better for his Children, then they do for themſelves; a pittiful tender-hearted Father, that is afflicted in all the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his; that will not afflict his too much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knows whereof they are made, that they are but Duſt, nor too long, leſt the Spirit faint, and the Soul which he hath made; a Father from whom they have received all the good they have had, and therefore to be contented to receive a little evil; and the rather, becauſe it is in order to their ſpiritual and eternal good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2.</p>
                  <p>Ah! but the pains of my Body are great, and the pangs of Death are bitter; but to quiet your ſpirits under theſe, Conſider, 1. That the pangs of Death, are ſometimes leſs then the pains they feel before; as to Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> who ſaid to his Friend, that askt him, How it was with him when the pangs of death were upon him? He ſaid to him, Your cold hand is the greateſt pain I feel, (in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Four laſt Things</hi>). 2. You are content to undergoe a great deal of pain here, for a little gain; how much more ſhould you for an eternal gain? Theſe pains are but like the throwes in Travail, to bring forth eternal Life. 3. Whatſoever your pains and ſufferings are, they are little, or nothing to thoſe your ſins made Chriſt to ſuffer, and that many of his dear and precious Saints have, and do ſuffer, and to thoſe eternal ſufferings Chriſt hath redeemed you from, and that exceeding exceſſive and eternal weight of glory that will follow your ſufferings, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To meditate on the many and great evils that Death will free you from; as 1. from
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:152821:99"/>a body of Sin and Death, that is ſtill inclining you to evil, and indiſpoſing you to good, ſtill dulling, deading, and diſtracting you in all the ſervices you do. 2. From a wicked World, wherein continually we ſee and hear what doth, and ſhould more vex our ſouls, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3. From the diſſention of Brethren, who are continually undermining the credit and comfort one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which made <hi>Melancton</hi> ſo willing to die; when a Friend of his askt him how it was with him, and whether he were willing to die? He anſwered, <hi>Oh yes, Not only that he might be freed from a body of Sin, and Death, and a wicked World, but from the diſſention of Brethren, and go there where all ſhall be perfected in love.</hi> 4. From a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Devil, that is ſtill tempting us to evil, and diſcouraging us from all that is good, walking up and down like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. In a word, from all La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Pains, Fears, Doubts, Sorrows, Sufferings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.4. Death will perfectly cure you of all Diſeaſes, Corporeal and Spiritual at once, both an aking Head, and an unbelieving Heart; a ſickly Body, and a diſtemper'd Spirit; the beſt Phyſitian that ever you met with.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To meditate on the many and great benefits Death will help you to, as that glorious Place, Company, Imployment, Priviledges you ſaw before in the Life of Glory, the continual Preſence of God, the bleſſed Viſion of God, the immediate, perfect, and everlaſting communion with God, perfection of Holineſs, fulneſs of Joy, and an everlaſting Sabbath.</p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:152821:100"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> To conſider the evil of being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to die: By this, Chriſtians manifeſt too much ignorance, unbelief, hypocriſie, love to the World, ſenſleſneſs of the body of Sin and Death, that World of wickedneſs they live in, and hereby procure more diſquiet to their Spirits, and haſten Death the ſooner upon them, beſides the great unreaſonableneſs of it, that when God ſhould be ſo willing of their company, they ſhould be ſo unwilling of his; and when Chriſt ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to leave Heaven, and to come to Earth for them; they ſhould be unwilling to leave Earth to go to Heaven, that they might enjoy him, and know, and profeſs it to be beſt of all to be with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> To meditate on the good of being willing to die. Hereby you will make a vertue of neceſſity, ſeeing you cannot put it off, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you will voluntarily yeeld to it; hereby you will manifeſt your hatred of ſin, contempt of the World, Faith in God's Promiſes, Love to God, deſire of immediate Communion with him, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour your Chriſtian Profeſſion, and make Death the leſs terrible to you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighthly,</hi> and Laſtly, Conſider what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſayes 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. to the end; Death is yours; Yours no way to hurt you, but every way to do you good.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. No way to hurt you, becauſe however it be a Serpent, yet 'tis a Serpent without a ſting; by ſtinging of Jeſus Chriſt to death, it loſt its ſting; ſo that though it may hiſs, yet it cannot hurt; however the Devil brought Jeſus Chriſt unto the Croſs, unto Death, unto the Grave, yet therein
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:152821:100"/>Jeſus Chriſt out-ſhot the Devil in his own Bow, ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, and made a ſhew of it openly, tryumphing over them on the Croſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. And that it can no way hurt you, appears further by theſe Particulars. 1. In that it is not the deſtruction or annihilation either of Soul or Body, but onely the alteration and change of their condition for the better: As for inſtance; 1. In the Body. The Body, by Death, is freed from all pains, and miſeries, and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and all ſin, which is the cauſe of them; as ſin brought Death into our bodies, ſo Death car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſin out of the body; and however theſe vile bodies be diſſolved into duſt, yet they ſhall be raiſed up again, at the laſt day, and be made like unto Chriſt's Glorious Body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> 2. For the Soul; It ſhall be no loſer, but a great gainer by Death, and that three wayes. 1. In the place it goes unto, <hi>viz.</hi> from Earth unto Heaven. 2. In the excellent qualities it ſhall be endowed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, <hi>viz.</hi> perfection in all the faculties of it, as it goes to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 3. In the excellent company it goes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, leaving the company of ſinners here, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enjoy the company of Saints and Angels, and the ever bleſſed Unity in Trinity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, In that it cannot hurt us, appears in that it can never diſſolve the Union between Chriſt and a believing Soul, but brings it to a nearer, ſweeter, and fuller Union; of a Gracious, makes it a Glorious Union; however it ſeparates Soul and Body one from the other, yet it cannot ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate either from Jeſus Chriſt; the Soul, upon Death, goes immediately unto Chriſt in Paradiſe,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:152821:101"/>and Chriſt goes down with the Body into the Grave, where it ſweetly reſts, as in its Bed, in the Arms of Jeſus Chriſt, until the morning of the Reſurrection of the Juſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.2. 1. It can never break the Covenant of Grace between God and the Soul, for it's an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. And he hath not only promiſed to be their God unto Death, but after Death, and to all eternity. 2. It can never untie the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-Knot between Chriſt and his Spouſe, for he hath betrothed her unto himſelf for ever, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. And whom he loves, he loves to the end, <hi>John</hi> 13.1. even with an everlaſting love, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 31.3. 3. It can never reverſe thoſe grants of Grace that God hath vouchſafed his, as the grants of Reconciliation, Juſtification, Adoption, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, Salvation, for the Gifts and Callings of God are without repentance, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.29.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly, As it is no way able to hurt you, ſo it will every way do you good. Though it be the laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed, yet of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my it ſhall be made a friend, and the beſt friend that ever you had: How ſo? Why, becauſe Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, by undergoing Death, and lying in the Grave, he hath altered the nature both of Death and the Grave; Death of a King of Terrors, it made a Prince of Peace; of a paſſage to eternal Death, made a paſſage to eternal Life unto all that do believe; the Grave that is a loathſome Dungeon to the wicked, is made a ſweet reſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place to the Saints. That you may the more clearly and fully ſee the good will come to you by Death, and ſo be made the more willing to it, and chearfully reſign your Spirit into the hands of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:152821:101"/>God, when he calls for it, take ſerious notice of theſe ten following Particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Death is no Death to a true Believer; It's not his laſt day, but the beginning of an everlaſting day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Your dying day, will not be your worſt day, but your beſt day; better is the day of a mans Death, then the day of his Birth, (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.1. it being the egreſs of all miſery, and the ingreſs of eternal felicity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Chriſtians dying day, it will be his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging day, when he ſhall be ſet at liberty out of the Priſon of the Body, and brought home to his Fathers Houſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. It is but as Chriſt ſtiles it, His departing and going to the Father, <hi>John</hi> 13.1.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A Chriſtians dying day, will be his reſting day, wherein he ſhall reſt from all ſinning, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing, ſuffering; from all temptations, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, vexations, <hi>Job</hi> 3.17. And who deſires not reſt?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. His dying day, will be his reaping day, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſown here in Tears, he ſhall reap in Joy; reap the fruit of all the Sermons they have heard, all the Prayers they have made, all the Tears they have ſhed, all the Sighs and Groans they have ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, all the good Thoughts they have had, all the good Words they have ſpoken, all the good Works they have done, all the Evils they have ſuffered, and all they have forgotten to do and ſuffer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34. When ſaw we thee an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and fed thee not? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then Chriſt will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them, and ſay, In that you did it unto them, ye did it unto me: Yea, there is not the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:152821:102"/>leaſt good work that any have done for any of his, but it ſhall be remembred and rewarded, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a cup of cold Water, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. <hi>laſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. A Chriſtians dying day, will be his conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tryumphing day over all his Enemies, Sin, Satan, and the World, Death and Hell; here we are in a continual warfare, there's not a day, hour, or moment wherein we can reſt, either from corruption within, or temptation without; but then, there ſhall be an end of all, then we ſhall tryumph over all, in the words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. <hi>Oh Death, where's now thy ſting? &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. A Chriſtians dying day, will be his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting day, from Earth to Heaven, from Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to Glory; from a Valley of Tears, to a Valley of bleſſed Viſions; from a howling Wilderneſs, to a heavenly Paradiſe: It is no other then a ſtraight Gate, to a Pallace of Glory; a dark Entry, to the Inheritance of the Saints in Light. And oh! Who would not be willing to exchange a <hi>Sodom</hi> for <hi>Sion,</hi> an <hi>Egypt</hi> for <hi>Canaan,</hi> Miſery for Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. A Chriſtians dying day, it's his uncloathing day of a body of Sin and Death, and the cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with his Houſe from Heaven; his putting off his old Rags of Sin and Corruption, and his putting on of the White Robe of Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and with it the Robe of Glory.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. A Chriſtians dying day, it's his marriage day with the Lamb, the King of Saints; and if the day of a Believers eſpouſals be ſo ſweet, how ſweet will the marriage day be? <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.7.</p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:152821:102"/>
                  <p n="10">10. A Chriſtians dying day, will be his corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation day, wherein Chriſt will crown all thoſe that love his appearance with the Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. where they ſhall be ſtill following the Lamb, with Crowns on their Heads, and Palms in their Hands, and tryumphant Songs in their Mouths, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.11, 12, 13. Mix theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations with Faith and Prayer, and you will find them mighty, through God, not only to make you willing, but even long, with the Apoſtle, to be diſſolv'd and be with Chriſt, which is beſt of all, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Amen</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>

Look to the ſincerity and uprightneſs of your heart in all your wayes; For if our hearts condemn us not, then we have confidence towards God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.21.

                  <p n="5">5. Meditate on the remedileſsneſs of thoſe torments.

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Meditate on the ſad company wicked men ſhall have in Hell: <hi>Viz.</hi> No other then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his Angels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41.

If the appearance of an evil ſpirit be ſo dreadful to them here, what will it be to be ſtill in their company and never ſuffered to go out of it? Conſider well but theſe two things: 1. Their ghoſtly deformity, they make Hell look black, (as one ſaith). 2. Their deadly antipathy, they are filled with rage againſt mankind; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, having been temptors here, they become for ever tormentors there.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Meditate and conſider, before it be yet too late, how inexpreſſibly the damned in Hell do, and will for ever bewail their folly and madneſs, in hearkening to, and following the temptations of the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpending their health and ſtrength, time and tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, in the ſervice of them; and neglecting ſo great Salvation, as was ſo frequently and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately offer'd them from time to time.</p>

In reſpect of the loving and kind imbracements of it, it's called <hi>Abraham's Boſom,</hi> Luke 16. 2. In regard of the pleaſure and delight of it, it's called <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> Luke 23.48. and the <hi>Joy of the Lord,</hi> Mat. 25. and the <hi>Fulneſs of Joy,</hi> Pſal. 16. <hi>laſt.</hi> 3.

                  <p>

                  <p n="1">1. The Evil of Sin. The Saints ſhall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be freed from the power of ſin, but from the very being of ſin; Grace here weakens Sin, but Glory there will wholly aboliſh it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. <hi>laſt.</hi> No unclean thing ſhall enter there.</p>

                  <p>TO meditate in and about it, of theſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, The Nature of it, The Worth of it, The greatneſs of the Loſs of it, The greatneſs of the Salvation of it, The Conſcience God hath put into it to mind you of all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Nature of it, what it is, <hi>ſc.</hi> A ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Subſtance, Inviſible, Immortal, Created of God, United to the Body, and endowed with admirable faculties, of Vegitation, Senſe, and Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To meditate on the tranſcendent worth or excellency of it: This appears,</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. By the excellent Majeſty of which it is an Image; nothing ſo much reſembles God, as the Soul. 1. In Spirituality. 2. In Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:152821:113"/>3. In the infinity of Comprehenſion or Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, By the excellent price was paid for the Redemption of a Soul; not Silver and Gold, but the precious Blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. Had all the Creatures in the World laid down their lives, they could never have done it; being finite Creatures, they could never have ſatisfied an infinite Juſtice.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly. By the excellent end, and the uſe of it, it being made to contemplate all thoſe glorious Excellencies that are in God, and in God for us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4thly, The tranſcendent excellency of it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Body, and above all the World.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Above the Body. 1. The Body, but an earthly Subſtance, the Soul a heavenly Subſtance. 2. The Body is a material and viſible Subſtance, the Soul a ſpiritual inviſible Subſtance. 3. The Body cannot live without the Soul, but the Soul can and doth without the Body. 4. The Soul not made for the Body, but the Body for the Soul, as the Box for a Jewel, and the Houſe for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Above all the World. One Soul's of more worth then all the World, then ten thouſand Worlds; as appears in this, That all the World, and ten thouſand Worlds cannot content and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Soul, no more then a Barley Corn can fill the World; the Soul is of ſo large and vaſt a capacity, as it's able to conceive of, and deſire millions of Worlds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Conſider the greatneſs of the Loſs of a Soul. There's no loſs to be compared to the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:152821:114"/>loſs of a Soul, becauſe he that loſeth it, loſeth all; not only himſelf, but God, and Chriſt, and Grace, and Glory, both this World, and that to come; and this loſs an irrecoverable loſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26. <hi>What will it profit a man to win the World, and loſe his Soul? Or what will he give in exchange for his Soul?</hi> Suppoſe a Man had all the Honours, Riches, Pleaſures the World could afford him, what will it avail him in the day of death, when he muſt part with all, and his Soul too, and never recover them more? Men may loſe theſe things of the World, and recover them again, (if God ſeeth good) as you may ſee in <hi>Job</hi>'s Caſe, to whom God reſtored all that he had taken from him, and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all to him in the latter end, <hi>Job</hi> 42. But now for a Soul, that being loſt, can never be recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it's not a World, nor ten thouſand Worlds can recover the loſs of a Soul, it coſt more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem a Soul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. Whereas you ſee the great folly of men, in ſelling and loſing of their Souls; What do they get by their ſin, but the Curſe and Wrath of God, with the loſs of their precious Souls?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To meditate on the greatneſs of the ſalvation of a Soul, and the means to procure the ſalvation thereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. The greatneſs of the ſalvation of the Soul; this appears, by the greatneſs of the Author of it, no other then the great God, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, The greatneſs of the price paid for it; no other then the precious Blood of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly, The greatneſs of the evil we are ſaved from; As, 1. The <hi>Curſe of the Law,</hi> Gal. 3.10,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:152821:114"/>13. and the <hi>rigour of the Law, Rom.</hi> 7.5, 6. 2ly, From the reign and dominion of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. 3. From the tyranny of Satan, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. 4. From the evil of the World, <hi>John</hi> 16. <hi>laſt.</hi> 5. The ſting of Death, and the ſlaviſh fear of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 15. 6. The wrath to come, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10.</p>
                  <p n="4">4thly, The greatneſs of the good things we are ſaved and brought unto, <hi>viz.</hi> The Life of Grace here, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. and the Life of Glory hereafter, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To meditate on the means. To make ſure and procure the means of Salvation to you, which are briefly theſe. 1. To ſee and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge your ſelves loſt in your ſelves, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.10. 2. To humble your ſelves under the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of it, <hi>James</hi> 4.9. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.31. 3. To turn every one from the evil of his wayes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.30. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7, 8. 4. To lay hold on Jeſus Chriſt, by a lively Faith, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. 5. To get a new Nature, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. 6. To lead a new Life, a Life of Holineſs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. and to order your Converſation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of the Word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>laſt. To him that orders his Converſation aright, I will ſhew the Salvation of God.</hi> Now here, to take notice what it is to order our Converſation aright, (I ſhall ſtay a little the longer, becauſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of moſt, are ſuch an open contradiction to their Profeſſion.) Now by ordering our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation aright, is meant, a putting of our Life in a method and order; a Saint muſt not walk at random, or at large, but in a regular and orderly way, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5. that is, According to thoſe rules
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:152821:115"/>laid down in the Scripture, the Law, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; and theſe Rules, according to which we are to order our Converſation, they are either more general, or more particular.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the General Rules; You have them laid down in two places, the firſt in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good. Q.</hi> Where hath he ſhewed Man his duty? <hi>A.</hi> Why, in his Word; there God hath laid down plainly what the Duty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man is, to God, and others, and himſelf, ſo as there is no Man or Woman can plead igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſay, he knew it not to be his duty, for God hath plainly revealed it in his Word, what is good; how that all in his Word is good, and will do good to him that doth it, <hi>Micah</hi> 2.7. <hi>Do not my Words do good to him that walks upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?</hi> And what the Lord requires of thee; What is that? 1. <hi>To do juſtly,</hi> i. e. To make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of all the Duties of Juſtice and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, required in the ſecond Table, <hi>to render to every one his due; and do unto others, as you would have others do unto you;</hi> which is the Law and the Prophets. 2. <hi>To love Mercy;</hi> that is, To ſhew mercy to the Bodies and to the Souls of others, as you have opportunity, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.16. 3. <hi>To walk humbly with thy God;</hi> This comprehends all the Duties of the firſt Table, as the two former of the ſecond Table. So as the meaning in ſhort is this, Thou ſhalt ſet God alwayes before thee, give him the Homage, Worſhip, and Service that is due to him; approve thy heart to him, in all the ſervice thou tendereſt to him; humble thy ſelf under thy fallings, and failings; acknowledge,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:152821:115"/>when thou haſt done all, thou art but an unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Servant, and deſire only to be found in the perfect obedience of Jeſus Chriſt: More clearly and fully you have theſe Duties laid down, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>The Grace of God, bringing Salvation, hath appeared to all men, teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World:</hi> Soberly, in reſpect of our ſelves; Righteouſly, in reſpect of others; Godlily, in reſpect of God.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Haec tria perpetuo meditare adverbia Pauli,</l>
                     <l>Haec tria ſunt vitae regula ſancta tuae.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Make theſe three Adverbs the ſubject of your continual Meditation, and the propoſed Rule of your daily Converſation: Your duty here is, as every day. 1. <hi>To watch againſt, and deny ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> that is, Thoſe ſins forbidden in the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo called, becauſe they are immediately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. And worldly luſts; that is, all ſins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid in the ſecond Table, called <hi>Worldly,</hi> becauſe they have the World for their Object and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. 2. It follows, <hi>and that we ſhould live ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly;</hi> the former contain'd the negative com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Law, theſe latter the affirmative commands of the Law; to note unto us, it is not enough to be negative Chriſtians, but we muſt be alſo affirmative Chriſtians, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>Ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Your duty is, <hi>to live ſoberly,</hi> in reſpect of your ſelves; that is, to be moderate in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and uſe of all Creature Comforts, as Meat, Drink, Apparel, Recreation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.30.</p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:152821:116"/>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Righteouſly,</hi> in reſpect of your Neighbours; that is, To act and exerciſe Righteouſneſs in all your Thoughts, Affections, Words, Actions, Tradings and Dealings with others, made a ſign of one that ſhall dwell in God's Holy Hill, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In reſpect of God, <hi>to carry your ſelves God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> or God-like; to be Holy, as he is Holy, in all manner of Converſation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. that is, Publickly, Privately, Secretly, Daily, Hourly, Continually, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. To quicken you to this godlineſs, to meditate on that place, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Godlineſs is profitable to all things, and hath the promiſe of this life, and that to come;</hi> that is, Hath all the bleſſings of Heaven and Earth entailed to it; it gives a Chriſtian much in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, all the Promiſes of this Life; and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more in Reverſion, the Life that is to come.</p>
                  <p>Godlineſs will be profitable whilſt you live, ſweeten and ſanctifie every ſtate and condition to you and yours, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.7. and will be much more profitable, when you die; when you are to leave all other things, this better part ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be taken from you, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. <hi>laſt.</hi> Thus of the general Rules.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For the more particular Rules, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the right ordering of our Converſation, they either reſpect <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>the Spirit, our Selves, and others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. For thoſe reſpecting <hi>God,</hi> they either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern his Attributes, Words, Works, Worſhip. 1. For the Attributes of God, you ought to know them, and to walk ſutably to them; let them have authority, and influence on your Hearts, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:152821:116"/>Wayes, to keep you from ſinning, and quicken you to well-doing, according to the directions given you before. 2. For his Word: To do nothing, but what you have a warrant for out of the Word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.9. <hi>Whereby ſhall a young man cleanſe his way, but by taking heed to thy Word?</hi> John 5.39. 1 John 4.1. Acts 17.12. Rom. 12.2. <hi>Prove what is the good and acceptable Will of God:</hi> God hath appointed it to be a Light to our Feet, and a Lanthorn to our Paths, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. He that walks not according to it, walks amiſs. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.29. <hi>Ye err, not knowing the Scriptures.</hi> As you are to walk according to the Word, ſo every part of it, the Precepts to obey them, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 119.2. the Promiſes to truſt in them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. and the Threatnings to fear them, <hi>Hebak.</hi> 3.16. 3. For the Works of God, you are to eye God in his wayes of Juſtice and Mercy, and to be humbled under the one, and thankful for the other; to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire him, and adore him, in what you cannot comprehend him; as the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33. <hi>Oh the depth of the riches both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God! how unſearchable are his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his wayes paſt finding out!</hi> 4. For the Worſhip of God, I have given you directions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet I will add theſe, to have an eye in the Worſhip of God to a right Perſon, Place, Manner, Time, End.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The duties of God's Worſhip, muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a right Perſon; as for inſtance, The Preaching of the Word, and the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, onely by a faithful Miniſter, called and ſent by God, and his Church; becauſe theſe are publick Duties, and therefore to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:152821:117"/>only by a publick Perſon: So Prayer in the Family, and inſtruction of thoſe in it, by the head of the Family, God having layed the charge of it upon him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Religious Duties, muſt be performed in a right place, as the Publick in Publick, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate in Private, Secret in Secret; the reaſon is, becauſe though there be no place forbidden, yet there be ſome places more convenient for ſome Duties then others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That there may be order, they muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and performed in a right time, and in due ſeaſon; as works of our general Calling in their ſeaſon, and of our particular in their ſeaſon; Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our general Calling, eſpecially on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath Day, and every morning and evening, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.2. The duties of our particular Calling, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the week day, and the greateſt part of the day; the reaſon is, Becauſe there is an appointed time for every purpoſe under Heaven, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.1. And becauſe what the Wiſe Man ſpeaks of, <hi>a word ſpoken in a ſeaſon,</hi> is true of <hi>an action done in ſeaſon;</hi> it's very beautiful, <hi>like an Apple of Gold in a Picture of Silver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. For the right manner, I gave you directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before at the beginning; onely remember ſtill this, all be <hi>with fear and reverence,</hi> Heb. 12. <hi>end.</hi> and <hi>in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> John 4.24. God abhors thoſe that draw near with their Lips, and their hearts are far from him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For the right ends you are to propoſe in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very duty, they are, That God may be glorified, others Edified, your Souls Sanctified and Saved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.20. <hi>John</hi> 15.8.</p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:152821:117"/>
                  <p n="2">2dly, There be other Rules reſpecting <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If you would order your Converſations aright, you are to do what you do in Knowledge, Faith, Repentance, Obedience, Love.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In Knowledge; becauſe <hi>this is Life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent,</hi> John 17.3. And becauſe all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, without Knowledge, is but blind Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In Faith: That God will accept of your Perſons and Services in him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. Becauſe <hi>without Faith it's impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. And <hi>whatſoever is not of Faith, is ſin,</hi> Rom. 14.23.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To do it in Repentance: Becauſe ſo long as men live, and lie impenitently in ſin, God will not regard any thing they do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.18.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In Obedience to his command: Becauſe he is the Author of Salvation only to as many as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. And ſuch as yeeld Univerſal Obedience, their unfeigned deſire, and earneſt endeavour, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>laſt. John</hi> 15.14.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To do all ye do, in Love to Jeſus Chriſt, as the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.14. <hi>The love of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains me:</hi> Becauſe, without Love, all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Duties will profit us nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. That you may be enabled to all this, you are to make Chriſt your Principle, your Pattern, and your Scope in all: 1. Your Principle, to fetch Grace and ſtrength from him to do it, becauſe we can do nothing without him, <hi>John</hi> 15.5. <hi>And it pleaſed the Father that all fulneſs ſhould dwell in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:152821:118"/>him, that we from that fulneſs might ſtill be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Grace for Grace.</hi> 2. To make him your Pattern, <hi>to walk as he walked,</hi> 1 John 2.6. How that was, you may read in the Goſpel, wiſely, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſively, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as we ſhewed you before in your Meditations on Chriſt. 3. To make him your Scope and end in all you do, that Chriſt may be magnified in your Bodies, in Life, and Death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19, 20.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly, Other Rules reſpect <hi>the Spirit of God;</hi> as theſe, 1. To hearken to, and obey his Call unto Faith and Repentance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.21. 2. To nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and cheriſh his motions within, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, checking you for evil, and exerciſing you to duty; and take heed you do not reſiſt him, as they, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.21. nor quench the Spirit, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19. nor grieve the Spirit, ſo as to cauſe him to depart, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.30. 3. To beg his help and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in every duty of your particular and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Calling, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.10.</p>
                  <p n="4">4thly, There are other Rules reſpecting <hi>our ſelves.</hi> If you would order your Converſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, ſo as to have God's gracious Preſence with you, Providence over you, and Bleſſing upon you all the day long, then to mind and obſerve well theſe Rules. To begin the day with God, and continue it with God, and end it with God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To begin the day with God, by giving him the firſt of our thoughts, when we awake, going apart; when you are up, to read the Scripture, meditate on the Word, pray unto God for your ſelves and others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.6. <hi>James</hi> 5.16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To continue the day with God thus. 1ſt. By a faithful, diligent, and fruitful diſcharge of the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:152821:118"/>duties of your Calling, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.4. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.6. 2ly, By a moderate, ſeaſonable, and thankful uſe of the Creatures, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.2. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3. 3dly. By walking with God all the day long, approving all your thoughts, and words, and wayes to his bleſſed Word, and all-ſeeing eye of God, eying his glory in all, as you are commanded, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. 4ly. By walking as becometh the Goſpel, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Q.</hi> How is that? <hi>A.</hi> Thus, To ſee that your walking be an Humble, Holy, Heavenly, Meek, Patient, Contented, Faithful, Chearful, Fruitful Walking. 1. An Humble walking before God and Man, <hi>Micha</hi> 6.8. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.2. 2. An Holy walking, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. 3. An Heavenly walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. 4. A Meek, Patient, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented walking, in every eſtate and condition, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>James</hi> 5.7. 5. A Faithful, ſincere and upright walking, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.9. 6. A Chearful ſerving him for the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all his goodneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.47. Laſtly, A Fruitful living under the means and wayes vouchſafed, <hi>John</hi> 15.5. Herein is my Father glorified, that you bring forth much Fruit to God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To end the day with God. 1. By reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and looking back on our carriage the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, toward God and Man, wherein we have been peccant and faulty, by way of commiſſion, in thought, word, and deed; by way of omiſſion, in publick, private, ſecret; and by way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection before, in, or after any duty; to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves under it, to renew our peace with God, by Jeſus Chriſt, and renewing our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:152821:119"/>of more circumſpection, and better obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for the future. 2. By obſerving what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, ſad, or glad, we had experience of the day before, and to be humbled and thankful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. 3. By cloſing up the day as you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan it, with Reading, Meditation, and Prayer. 4. By giving God the laſt of your thoughts, when you lie down to ſleep, as you gave him the firſt when you did awake, that ſo your ſleep may be the more ſweet and comfortable to you; and whether you ſleep or wake, preſent in the body, or abſent from it, you may be accepted of the Lord, found in peace, and be received into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting peace, that eternal reſt which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the People of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5thly, There be other Rules, which reſpect others: For the right ordering our Converſation, towards thoſe within the Family, and thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Family.</p>
                  <p n="1">[1.] <hi>Thoſe within the Family.</hi> That you may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your converſation aright towards them. 1. You are to make your Families little Churches, in the obſervance and performance of thoſe Religious Duties you ow to God, and the Souls of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your charge, as thoſe that I have already di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected you in, <hi>viz.</hi> A careful ſanctifying of the Sabbath, a heedful attendance on the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, Prayer evening and morning with the Family, reading of the Scriptures, ſinging of Pſalms, repetition of Sermons, inſtruction of thoſe under your charge in the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, correction of their evils, and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them in wayes of well doing; for all theſe

Every one to ſtudy, and acquaint others under them, with their relative Duties, each to the other, as Husband to Wife, and Wife to Husband; Parents to Children, and Children to Parents; Maſters to Servants, and Servants to Maſters; and to go one before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the obſervance and practice of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we find Examples generally more prevailing then Precepts: and herein lyeth the Life and Power of Godlineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> In a Faithful, Fruitful, Chearful diſcharge of our Relative Duties; whence you ſhall find the Apoſtle more frequent and full in preſſing them in his Epiſtles, then other Duties: What thoſe Relative Duties are, you have many Books to help you in, (as <hi>Gouge,</hi> and <hi>Caudry,</hi> and others) to quicken you unto a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable care of theſe things; conſider, in ſhort, it's the greateſt good you can do, not onely for your Families, but for the Pariſh, Town, City, Countrey, Church and State you live in; for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral experience ſhews us, that they are Families, which are Seminaries and Nurſeries of all good and evil, and therefore to have a ſpecial eye to, and care of Family Duties; and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the conſcionable performance of theſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, bring down all manner of bleſſings in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; but the neglect, all manner of Judgments, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.10, 25.

Above all, That they be Patterns to others of good works, as the Apoſtle exhorts, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. &amp; 3.1, 2, 3, 4. &amp; <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.7, 8. And that, 1. becauſe general experience ſhews, that People are more led by the Life, then the Doctrine of Miniſters; are led more by the Eye, then the Ear, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.17. 2ly, Becauſe otherwiſe they will pull down more in one hour, then they will build up all their lives. 3. Becauſe otherwiſe, their Doctrine will be at the laſt, a Bill of Indictment againſt themſelves; and having Preached to others, will be found Caſt-awayes themſelves, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. And therefore it concerns Miniſters to look well to their lives, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially that they be not found amongſt thoſe wicked ones, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.10, 11, 12. And as Miniſters are to be Patterns in all other Graces, ſo eſpecially in two Graces; 1. Humility, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. Love to their Fellow Brethren, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. 2. And love to their People, as the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. Whence they are called <hi>Fathers,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.15. and <hi>Nurſes.</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.7, 8. to note that tender love and affection they ought to have to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple committed to their charge, and eſpecially their Souls.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To Magiſtrates.</hi> If you would order your Converſation aright towards them, then you are to give them that Love, Fear and Reverence, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Prayer for them the Scripture fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently calls for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. from 1, to 9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, to 18. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>For Miniſters.</hi> If you would order your Converſations aright to them, you are to give them that Love, Reverence, Maintenance, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and Prayer, the Scripture alſo frequently calls for 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.10. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.1.

                  <p n="2">2dly, <hi>For Private Chriſtians.</hi> The Rules that are to be obſerved by them, for the right ordering of their Converſation one towards the other, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect their Thoughts and Affections, Words and Actions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Reſpecting their Thoughts. And in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this; 1. Take heed of inſtilling, receiving,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:152821:121"/>and nouriſhing prejudices in your minds againſt others; for this is a very great &amp; provoking evil. 2. That you may be kept from it, take notice, 1. What it is. 2. Why you are to avoid it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What prejudice is, <hi>viz.</hi> A prejudging, or a prepoſterous judgment of Perſons and Things, before they be examined and tryed. Should a Judge paſs Sentence on a Perſon or Action, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had examined it, he ſhould err, though the Sentence were juſt, ſeeing he never lookt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, nor knew the grounds on which a Perſon ſpake, or did this and that thing. More plainly, Prejudice is an evil Opinion, which a man takes up of another, for ſomething he hath ſpoken and done, contrary to his Judgment and Practice, not knowing or conſidering the ground on which he did it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now ſuch as would order their Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aright to others, muſt take heed of it, becauſe it is a very great pernicious and provoking evil; as too ſad and general experience ſhews it to be, to the great diſhonour of God, ſcandal of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the hurt of their Brother; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This prejudice is that which makes men take up hard thoughts, of thoſe of whom God hath good thoughts, and to inſtil theſe evil thoughts into the Heads and Hearts of others, that they may diſengage the affections of others, and draw their affections only unto themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It makes men to rob God of his Glory, and give it to Men .1. To rob God of his Glory, in ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping up into his Throne, &amp; ſitting in Judgment on their Brother, and that ſometimes for a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:152821:122"/>Act, and it may be for a thing indifferent to their Brother, though not to them. Now what ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another mans Servant?</hi> and verſ. 10. <hi>Why doſt thou judge thy Brother, and ſet at nought thy Brother? we ſhall all ſtand before the Judgement-Seat of Chriſt.</hi> 2. It makes men to give glory to men, in crying up ſome, and crying down others; which the Apoſtle expreſly condemns in his <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.3. and whatſoever thoughts they have of their wiſdom in it, he tells them, the Lord knows their thoughts to be vain; and their duty is not to glory in men, ſo as to ſet up one above the other, (when all are faithful and ſound in the main) ſeeing all are their Servants in Chriſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.21, 22. 3. This prejudice it makes men to ſeparate, and withdraw communion from thoſe, with whom God hath communion; and that in thoſe eſſential Duties of God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as Word, Sacrament, Prayer, wherein all are expreſly required to worſhip God together: Yea, and makes them not only to ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but perſwade others to do it, leſt they partake in other mens ſins. 4. It's that which makes Profeſſors to reſt in duty, and neglect the actings of Grace before, in, and after Duty, eſpecially that Grace of Love, (which Chriſt makes the chief Character of a Diſciple, and without which, God abhors and rejects all other duties that men perform, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.) that alſo which cauſeth them to diſſent in their love, how that they do love others of a contrary Opinion and Practice; and yet can neglect, if not worſe, even perſwade others to caſt off all offices of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:152821:122"/>love to them, never remembring or conſidering the command is expreſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9. Let love be without diſſimulation, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.18. Let us not love in Word and Tongue, but in Deed, and Truth. 5. That which keeps men from abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of good they might do to others, and that they might receive from others, becauſe they think they ought to have no communion with them; ſo as this prejudice is like choller in the Stomack, that imbitters all wholſom meat; and however it receives it, yet caſts it up again. 6. That which makes men to murder others Bodies, Souls, Names and Eſtates: 1. Their Bodies; by cauſing grief to them, and ſuch grief as brings ſometimes ſickneſs and weakneſs on them, if not death. 2dly. Their Souls; by intterrupting their peace, and expoſing them to temptations, which made <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> for to pray, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.3 4. <hi>Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us; for we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly filled with contempt, with the ſcorning of thoſe that are at eaſe, and with the contempt of the proud.</hi> 3dly, Their Names; by blotting and blurring them with lies, and tales, and ſlanders, 4thly, Their Eſtates; By taking off the Hearts and Affections of others from any way ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyzing with them, and ſuccouring them in their wants and neceſſities. Now he that ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery,</hi> ſaid alſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Kill,</hi> James 2.11. And the Killing there, is principally killing by the tongue, as is clear from the contexts; and will it not be a ſad thing one day for Profeſſors to be found amongſt Murderers of their Brethren; 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.15. <hi>He that hates his Brother, is a Murderer.</hi> Laſtly, This preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:152821:123"/>is that which multiplies diviſions in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Pariſhes, Towns, Cities, Kingdoms, and opens a gap to the common Enemy, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade, enter, and prey upon all, to the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Religion, ſadding of God's People, and the rejoycing of wicked men, if not the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine of Church and State; and therefore in all theſe reſpects. 1. To take heed of inſtilling, receiving and nouriſhing prejudices againſt any of God's Faithful Miniſters, or People, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take heed of evil and miſchievous thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt others, expreſly forbid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.29. <hi>Deviſe not evil againſt thy Neighbour that dwells quietly by thee,</hi> Zach. 8.17. <hi>Let none imagine evil in his heart againſt his Neighbour.</hi> For this you may find, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 6.7.) is one of thoſe ſix things that the Lord hates. 1. Take heed alſo of over-va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing thoughts of ſome, and undervaluing thoughts of others, (when both are godly) for there ought to be no reſpect of perſons in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; God is no reſpecter of perſons, he regards not the rich more then the poor, <hi>Job</hi> 34.19. the noble, then the ignoble; the wiſe, then the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and you ought to be followers of God in this, becauſe if you have reſpect to perſons, ye commit ſin, and are convinced of the Law, as tranſgreſſors, <hi>James</hi> 2.9. And therefore the command is expreſs in the firſt verſ. <hi>My Brethren have not the Faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons.</hi> 2. As not to take up hard thoughts, ſo to have good thoughts of others of whom God hath good thoughts, how differing ſoever from you in Opinion and Practice, ſeeing ſo long as we are here, (there being different degrees of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:152821:123"/>Light given in by God unto Chriſtians) there will be different apprehenſion of things; it is that which the Apoſtle exhorts unto, <hi>Philip</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and if in any thing you be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal it unto you; nevertheleſs, whereunto we have already attained, let us walk by the ſame rule.</hi> It is our duty (what in us lies) to labour after Unity in Opinion and Judgment; that which the Apoſtle preſſeth by many Arguments, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1, 2. But yet, however, ſeeing we cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Unity in Opinion, we ought to expreſs Unity in Affection; that which the Apoſtle preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by many more Arguments, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.1, <hi>to</hi> 7. Thus of the Rules concerning our Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Rules reſpecting our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 1. That <hi>you put off anger, wrath malice, &amp;c.</hi> Col. 3.8. Epheſ. 4.26. 2. That <hi>you put on (as the Elect, Holy, and Beloved of God) bowels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another; and above all, you put on Love,</hi> (the bond of perfectneſs) that which like a Bond knits Chriſtians, and Graces, and Duties together, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12, 13 14. See <hi>that all your things be done in Love,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.14. becauſe this is the beſt Character of a Diſciple of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 13.35. And all duties, without love, will profit nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. To ſee alſo this love of yours be a ſincere love, without diſſimulation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9. and a real love, not in word and tongue, but in deed and truth, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14. To love them, not for Opinions ſake, or Parties ſake, for that is to love a mans ſelf in them, but for holineſs
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:152821:124"/>ſake, the truths ſake, 2 <hi>John</hi> 1. To love them as Saints, and ſo to love all, one Saint as well as another, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.4. To love them, as we do love our ſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8, 9. And you know how we love our ſelves, we would do no hurt to our ſelves, ſo neither ſhould we unto others; we would do all the good we can to our ſelves, ſo ſhould we to others; we would have others to ſympathize with us in all our wants, ſorrows, and ſufferings, and ſo ſhould we with others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.3. We would have others conſtant in their love to us, and ſo ſhould we in our love to others; for charity, true charity, abides for ever, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>laſt.</hi> And the Apoſtle's exhortation is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 23.1. <hi>Let Brotherly love continue,</hi> and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God's love continues to his, and we would have it continue unto us, therefore ours ſhould continue to him and his.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For the Rules reſpecting our Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, we are to take heed of ſome things, and to practiſe others.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. The things you are to take heed of, they are theſe. 1. Take heed of ſpeaking of other mens Perſons, or Affairs, when you have no call to it, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Study to be quiet, and meddle every one with his own buſineſs.</hi> 2. Take heed you ſpeak evil of no man, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.2. The Reaſons you have, <hi>James</hi> 4.11. becauſe he that ſpeaks e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of his Brother, and judgeth his Brother, ſpeaks evil of the Law, and judgeth the Law: Becauſe the Lord hearkens and hears every word you ſpeak againſt any of his, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. And what is ſpoken againſt any of his, he takes as
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:152821:124"/>ſpoken againſt himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. More eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, you are to take heed of all raſh and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable ſpeaking, and cenſuring others that differ from you in Opinion and Practice, it being the Character of a Hypocrite, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.5. that which doth expoſe them to the judgment both of God and Man; eſpecially take heed it be not for a particular error or evil; for as one Swallow makes not a Summer, ſo neither doth a particular error or evil denominate any to be a Heretick or a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. If God ſhould fall out with men (as they do one with the other) for particular Offences and Differences, wo, wo, would be unto them; ſuch ſhould mind well what Chriſt ſaid to the <hi>Phariſees, He that is without ſin, let him caſt the firſt ſtone,</hi> John 8.7. Not that he approved of her ſin, but condemned their uncharitableneſs. 3. Take heed of ſlandering and backbiting ſpeech, expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.16. Thou ſhalt not go up and down as a Tale-bearer, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.9. Remember what God did to <hi>Miriam,</hi> when you came out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> What was that? He ſmote <hi>Miriam</hi> with a Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie for ſpeaking evil of his Servant <hi>Moſes,</hi> Numb. 12.8, 9. Exemplarily alſo did he puniſh this ſlandering Tongue in <hi>Doeg,</hi> Pſal. 52. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take warning, leſt you be made examples to others, that would not take example by others. 4. Above all, take heed of ſlandering publick Perſons, God's Magiſtrates and Miniſters; for they being in God's place, he will more ſeverely puniſh the wrong done to them, as you may ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Jude</hi> 9.10. 5. Take heed of diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, falſe lying ſpeech, as being that which is plainly forbid, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.9. That which evidenceth
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:152821:125"/>ſuch to be of their Father the Devil, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. God's Children, are Children that will not lie, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.8. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.13. A deceitful tongue ſhall not be found in their mouth; that which ſhuts men out of Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. <hi>laſt.</hi> and gives them a hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and a lower place in Hell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. <hi>laſt.</hi> 6. Take heed of all ſoothing flattering Speech, for the gaining and retaining the favour of others; there's a woe pronounced againſt ſuch, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.20. and God threatens to cut off ſuch flattering tongues, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.5. <hi>Job</hi> 17.5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, Other things are to be practiſed; as, 1. Watchfulneſs over your words, to ſee they be wiſe, deliberate, gracious and profitable, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.29. 2. If there be any difference between you and others, to ſeek and accept of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.23. &amp; 18.15. 3. To exhort one another daily, leſt any ones heart be hardened through the decitfulneſs of ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. 4. To admoniſh, reprove, and rebuke ſin in others, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſpoſition of the Perſon, and the nature of the offence, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. 5. To edifie one the other in Grace and gracious Practiſes, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24, 25. 6. To pray one with the other, and for the other, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18. <hi>James</hi> 5. Laſtly, To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate your Gifts, and Graces, and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, you have had of God's faithfulneſs and goodneſs in his Promiſes and Providences, after the Example of <hi>David,</hi> Come, and I will tell you what he hath done for my Soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> For your actions and carriage towards others; if you would order your Converſation aright, obſerve theſe Rules. 1. Not to retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:152821:125"/>or revenge any wrong done to you, in word or deed, but commit all to him, who judgeth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, after the example of Chriſt, as you are expreſly required, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.22. &amp; 24.29. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>three laſt verſes.</hi> 2. No man to ſeek his own things onely, but the things of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.4. not his own weal, but the weal of others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>end.</hi> 3. To walk wiſely, both towards thoſe without and within, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. Be wiſe as Serpents. 4. To walk inoffenſively, giving no juſt offence to any in word or deed, in apparel or recreation, as <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> and <hi>Eliſabeth,</hi> Luk. 1.6. and the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16. and we are all command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32. For God choſe us before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World, that we ſhould be holy and unblameable before him in love, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18. As much as in you lieth, live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with all men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.19. Follow after thoſe things which make for peace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. And that you may walk and live thus peaceably. 1. To take heed of all unpeaceable luſts, ſuch as theſe, Pride, Paſſion, Envy, Jealouſie, Cenſoriouſneſs, Selfiſhneſs, Affectation of Popularity, glorying in Men, having the Faith of our Lord Jeſus in reſpect of Perſons: for, <hi>James</hi> 4.1. <hi>From whence comes Wars and Fightings? are they not hence, from your luſts that are within you.</hi> 2. To labour after peaceable Principles; for unleſs there be a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of peace, or a peaceable diſpoſition within, there will not be long any ſound, or laſting peace without. 3. To get peaceable Graces, as amongſt others, theſe, Wiſdom, Humility, Sincerity, Amity, Meekneſs, Self-denial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. To
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:152821:126"/>make conſcience of peaceable duties, eſpecially theſe two. 1. The renewing of our peace with God, and God will make others to be at peace with you, <hi>Tranquillus Deus, tranquillat omnia;</hi> God's Promiſe is, <hi>If a mans wayes pleaſe the Lord, he will make his Enemies to be at peace with him,</hi> Prov. 16.7. 2. To pray one anothers affections into a peaceable frame, that he who makes thoſe of one houſe to be of one mind, would alſo make thoſe of one and the ſame Church, to be of one and the ſame mind; if not of the ſame Opinion in every thing, yet of the ſame Affection and Converſation.</p>
                  <p>The fifth thing then to be meditated on, in, and about the Soul, is the Conſcience, which is that faculty God hath put into the Soul, to mind us of all theſe duties; in and about the Conſcience, to take notice,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What Conſcience is, <hi>viz.</hi> That Faculty God hath placed in the Soul, to take notice of all our Affections, Speeches, Actions, and to paſs ſentence on them, according to the nature of them, by ſuch principles of Light as it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What the Offices of Conſcience are; as 1. To be a School-maſter to teach and make known what Sin and Duty is. 2. To be a Notary, to take notice of all our inward and outward behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. 3. To be a Regiſter, to write down and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord all. 4. To be a Witneſs, either to excuſe or accuſe. 5. To be a Judge to paſs Sentence, either of Abſolution or Condemnation. 6. To be an Executioner, to comfort or afflict according to the nature of the actions.</p>

To meditate on the great authority and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Conſcience, to make a man happy or miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as being God's Deputy or Vice-gerent to act for him; the beſt Friend, and the worſt Enemy; that which comforts and ſpeaks for us, when others diſcomfort and ſpeak againſt us, and that both in life and death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>This is our rejoycing, in the teſtimony of our Conſciences, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 38.3. Therefore ſhould you meditate on theſe things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Soul; 1. On the Nature of the Soul, what it is, that ſo you may look more after it then you have formerly done. 2. Therefore on the worth of the Soul above the Body, becauſe this will make you ſlight and undervalue both in compariſon of the Soul; prize and keep your Souls as your chiefeſt Jewels; to mind more the feeding and cloathing, preſerving and cheriſhing of your Souls, then your Bodies. 3. Therefore to meditate on the greatneſs of the loſs of it, becauſe it will put you more on a care of uſing the means for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of it, and that you do not hazard the loſs of it, for the gain of all the World. 4. Therefore on the greatneſs of the Salvation of it, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may be quickned to give all diligence in the uſe of the means for the Salvation of it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 10. giving all diligence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. Therefore to meditate on thoſe things about the Conſcience, that they ſhould make you fear and tremble to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and wound Conſcience, and the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to preſerve the peace of a good Conſcience, as it did <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 39.9. and the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16.</p>

                  <p n="1">1ſt. On the admirable Structure of it, both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and outwardly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Inwardly.</hi> The inward frame ſo admirable, as <hi>David</hi> wonders at it, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 139.13, to 17. <hi>I will praiſe thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>For the outward form of it.</hi> 1. Man was made naked, whereas all other Creatures have Scales, Horns, Feathers, and nothing ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and comely as Man; nakedneſs was an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the fall. 2. Man was made with the Countenance upward, whereas all other Creatures have it downwards. 3. With Speech to expreſs his mind, to the edification and comfort of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. 4. With Hands, which all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures want, whereby he might rule and govern the Creatures, feed and cloath himſelf, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch all his buſineſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, To meditate on the excellent and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable uſe of the Body, in that God hath made it not onely the Organ and Inſtrument of the Soul to work in and by it, but the Habitation of the Holy Ghoſt to dwell in it, and his Temple to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up Spiritual Sacrifice to God in it; the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this will make you the more watchful and careful to preſerve it in purity and chaſtity, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.4, 5. to uſe every ſenſe and member of it,

                  <p>In it to meditate on the ends wherefore God gave it, which are eſpecially two.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To glorifie God; whence the ſame word in the Hebrew, that ſignifies <hi>Tongue,</hi> ſignifies <hi>Glory,</hi> becauſe we are to glorifie God with it, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 108.1. &amp; 35.28. &amp; 63.5. 2.

                  <p n="2">2. To conſider the great need we have to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it to theſe ends. 1. Becauſe God hearkens and hears if any man ſpeaks aright, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath corrected raſh and unadviſed ſpeaking in his moſt eminent Saints, as in <hi>Moſes,</hi> Pſal. 106.32, 33. 3. Becauſe, for every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak, they muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at the Day of Judgment. 4. Becauſe in the right uſage of the Tongue, the fear of the Lord, and the comfort of a mans life doth chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſt, as you may ſee by comparing the <hi>11th</hi> verſe, with the 12 and 13 of the <hi>34th</hi> Pſalm. The ſerious meditation of this, will make us take better heed to our tongues, as it did <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 39.1. and pray with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.3. <hi>Set thou a watch before my mouth, and keep the door of my lips:</hi> To look to this our Speeches, be wiſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate, gracious and profitable.</p>

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Of the Talents.</head>
                  <p>In and about them, conſider. 1. There are none but have ſome <hi>Talents</hi> given of God, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, for the glory of God, and the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſome have <hi>Talents</hi> of Gifts and Grace, more means and ſeaſons of Grace then others; ſome have <hi>Talents</hi> of Health, Strength, Wealth, Honour; ſome more, ſome leſs; ſome ten, ſome five, ſome one; and all theſe put into their hands to imploy for their Lord and Maſters advantage, for the glory of God, and the good of Souls, their own and others, eſpecially thoſe under their charge, as you may ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. And to whom much is given, much will be required, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. And therefore to enquire every one what <hi>Talents</hi> we have received, and how we have prized them and improved them; whether we have or do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them to the ends God gave them, and as our Conſciences and Converſations can witneſs for or againſt us, to be humbled and thankful accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>In and about that, to meditate on theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The preciouſneſs of <hi>Time;</hi> ſo precious it is, that on the well or ill imployment of it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the eternal wel-fare, or ill-fare of your Souls; ſo precious, as all the Gold and Silver in the World cannot purchaſe one moment of it when its paſt; which made one cry out bitterly, <hi>(A World of Wealth, for an Hour of Time)</hi> ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as nothing the damned in Hell will more bewail, then the loſs of it; and if there were any hope of getting out, would imploy it better, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the beginning of the World to the end, could they live ſo long.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider the greatneſs of the work we have to do, and the little time we have to do it in: 1. For the greatneſs of the Work; it is to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:152821:129"/>God, ſerve our Brethren, ſave our Souls, clear up our intereſt in Chriſt, make our Calling and Election ſure, work out our Salvation with fear and trembling; and how little time have we for the doing all this? <hi>Ars longa, vita brevis.</hi> Let us ponder it ſeriouſly, it is but a moment of time, (in compariſon of Eternity) and on this moment depends the eternity of our well-being or ill-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therefore concerns us very much to ſpend it very well; and the rather, becauſe, <hi>Tam diu vivimus, quam bene vivimus,</hi> We have lived no longer then we lived well.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider the uncertainty of our time here; <hi>Our dayes on earth are as a ſhadow, and there is none durable or abiding,</hi> 1 Chron. 29.15. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>There's a time to be born, and a time to die,</hi> Eccleſs. 3.2. but mentions no time of living, as if it were ſo ſhort, that it were not worth the naming; and this ſhort time, when it's paſt, cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be recall'd; and the time to come none of ours, the time preſent only is ours, and therefore ſee that be imployed well in ſome duties, either of our particular or general Calling; we ſhould be either like Chriſt, alwayes doing good, or like <hi>Mary,</hi> ſtill receiving good, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold, now is the accepted time, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider how highly, not onely the wiſe Chriſtians, but the very Heathens, have prized time ſo, as to account that day loſt, wherein they have not done ſome good with Tongue, or Pen, or Purſe; and therefore how much more ſhould Chriſtians, that have more light to ſhew them the weightineſs of their work, and the brevity and preciouſneſs of their time. To meditate on
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:152821:129"/>the expreſs command, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Redeem the time, becauſe the dayes are evil.</hi> Here take notice of three things. 1 From what you are to redeem the time. 2. Unto what. 3. Why.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From what you are to redeem the time: You are to redeem it out of the hands of thoſe who would ſteal it away from God and your Souls; as, 1. Idleneſs and her Daughters, <hi>viz.</hi> vain I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations, and idle Diſcourſes. 2. Worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and her Daughters, <hi>viz.</hi> inordinate carking and caring, toyling and termoiling about the things of the World. 3. Voluptuouſneſs and her Daughters, <hi>viz.</hi> vain ſporting, rioting, feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, proud apparelling, immoderate and unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſleeping. Theſe we find, by ſad and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral experience, to take up and conſume the moſt of the precious time of men and women; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhould do well to reflect and look back, wherein you have been peccant and faulty, how much of your precious time hath been ſtollen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by theſe time-devourers; how much time hath been ſpent every day in Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, Tricking, Triming, Fidling, Dancing, Carding, Dicing, and the like vain Sports; and how little in Hearing, Reading, Praying, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, holy Conference, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How much the vanities of the World, carnal Pleaſures, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Viſits, unprofitable Diſcourſes, and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Recreations have eaten up, and to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your ſelves under it, and redeem your time out of the hands of theſe Thiéves for the future; more eſpecially, to ask your own Conſciences, and look into your Converſation, how you have imployed the time of your Youth, the means and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:152821:130"/>ſeaſons of Grace, the opportunities you have had of doing and receiving good, the times of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either Perſonal, Family, National, what good you have gotten or done in and by all; otherwiſe very Heathens will riſe up in judgement againſt you. Take notice,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What you are to redeem it unto, <hi>viz.</hi> The promoting of the Glory of God, the publick Good, and your ſpiritual and everlaſting Well-fare, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.3. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137.5. <hi>John</hi> 6.27.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the grounds why you are ſo to redeem it; you have it here in the Text, <hi>Becauſe the dayes are evil,</hi> full of the evil of Sin, full of the evil of Puniſhment; never did iniquity more abound, and never was the wrath of God more revealed from Heaven, then in our dayes; and therefore to redeem time, that we may be fitted for the worſt of times, and the beſt of dayes.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Meditate how bitterly men have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed the loſs of their time on their Death-beds, and do ſtill in Hell, and what they would be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do and ſuffer, if they might have further time; but all in vain, in vain did ſhe cry out, <hi>Call back Time, Oh call back Time;</hi> Time being paſt, not a moment to be recalled.</p>
                  <p>A ſerious meditation of theſe things, may (through the bleſſing of God) be an effectual means to make you prize and improve better your time then ever you have done.</p>

                     </gap>ctual Sphear, (as one obſerves) whoſe Center's every where, and Circumference no where. For the better underſtanding of it, take notice, there is a double Eternity; one <hi>a parte ante,</hi> and another <hi>a parte poſt;</hi> one that hath neither beginning nor end, another that hath a beginning, but no end. For the firſt; ſo God onely is Eternal, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.10, 13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.1, 8. And the things of God, as his Attributes, as his Truth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 117.2. Mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.1. Righteouſneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.142, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the other Eternity, which hath a beginning, but no end, This the Eternity of Angels and Men, and this Eternity is that we are to ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the kinds of Eternity. There is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Eternity, of Woe and Joy, Miſery and Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. 1. Of Woe and Miſery, that ſhall befal the wicked; and of Joy and Felicity, which ſhall be beſtowed on the godly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>laſt.

                  </p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:152821:131"/>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſhould conſider, that we ſtand every day before the door of Eternity, and we know not how ſoon we may lanch forth into that Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, from whence there's no return.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. How bitterly men will bewail at laſt (when 'tis too late) their folly and madneſs, in loſing a Bleſſed Eternity, and incurring a Curſed Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; how unconceiveably miſerable it will be for men to loſe Heaven and lie in Hell, ſo long as God is God. He found it, by bitter experience, that cryed out on his Death-bed, <hi>Oh Eternity, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Eternity! in Hell for ever, for ever, for ever!</hi> This word <hi>ever,</hi> will break the hearts of men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever they enter upon the borders of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and therefore think ſeriouſly upon it, before it be too late, and let it be your morning and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Thoughts.

               <p>IN and about this, to meditate on three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Thoſe things in the Creatures, that engage our hearts to love God.</item>
                  <item>2. Thoſe things in the Creatures that diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our hearts from inordinate love to, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the Creature.</item>
                  <item>3. Thoſe duties we owe to God for the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the Creatures teach us to perform to God.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> To meditate on thoſe things in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which diſcover the love of God to us, and that engage our hearts again to love him. As for inſtance, The Magnitude, Multitude, Variety, Beauty, Structures, Vertues, Sympathy and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy of the Creature.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Magnitude or Greatneſs of the Creature; <hi>Who can meaſure the breadth of the Earth, and the depth of the Sea?</hi> (ſaith the wiſe man) <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 13. And if the Earth be ſo great, how great is the whole World? The Earth is but a Point, in compariſon of the Heavens Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Multitude of the Creatures: Who can number the Sand of the Sea? and if not the Sand, much leſs all the Creatures that are in, and under, and above the Earth; all the Secretaries
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:152821:132"/>of Nature cannot number the kinds of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, much leſs the <hi>Individuaes,</hi> Jer. 33.22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.25.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the Variety of the Creatures. This is much more wonderful. As there are innumerable Kinds of Creatures, ſo there are kinds of divers forms and faſhions one from the other. Amongſt ſo many thouſand Pebles on the Sea-ſhore, you cannot find two ſtones alike in all things; amongſt ſo many thouſand Heards of Cattle, you cannot find two Beaſts alike in all things; amongſt ſo many thouſand Men and Women that are in the World, you cannot find two perſons alike in all things, but they differ in Face, or Voice, or Geſture.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For the Beauty of the Creature. How hath the Lord bedeckt the Heavens with Stars, the Earth with all variety of Beauties, well dreſſed Gardens, fruitful Orchards, green Meadows, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Woods, ſweet Fountains, Chryſtal Streams, all variety of Colours; ſo as <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his Royalty, was not cloathed as the Lilly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.29.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For the Structure of the Creatures, how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable is this? In the leaſt, as well as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; the Soul of a little Fly (ſayes <hi>Auſtin</hi>) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels the glorious Body of the Sun; the Teeth of a Moth, as wonderful as the Tusks of a Boar; the Thigh of a ſlender Gnat, not inferior to the Thigh of the hugeſt Elephant; the Wings of a Butter-fly, may compare with the Wings of an Eagle. There's not the leaſt Creature, but is ſo admirably fram'd, as all the Artiſts in the World not able to mend or make the like.</p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:152821:132"/>
               <p n="6">6. For the Vertues of the Creature. How won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful is this in the Elements above, and the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets beneath, in the Herbs, and Trees, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stones; there is no Creature, even the vileſt and baſeſt, but is good for ſome uſe or other.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For the Sympathy of the Creatures, and the Antipathy between them. How ſtrong is this? No reaſon can be given of the ſweet agreement between the Load-ſtone and the Iron, the Lilly and the Garlick, nor of the mortal hatred between the Swan and the Eagle, the little Birds and the Owl.</p>
               <p>A ſerious meditation on theſe things, will not onely diſcover the great love of God, and draw out your hearts the more in love to him, who hath done all theſe things for you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To meditate on thoſe things in the Creatures that may diſingage your hearts from the inordinate love of them, and the eager purſuit of them; amongſt others, on theſe things, The Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Uncertainty, Unſatisfactorineſs, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Unprofitableneſs, Deceitfulneſs, Hurtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the great folly of men in making them their portion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>On the Vanity of them.</hi> Being things in ſhew, rather then in ſubſtance; appearance, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then reality; <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine eyes upon that which is not? Viz.</hi> In reſpect of any advantage and comfort, when God withdraws himſelf from the Creature, then they are like ſtanding Pools in Summer, dryed up, when the Creature comes to make uſe of them; yea, they are not onely vain in the <hi>Concrete,</hi> but vanity it ſelf in the <hi>Abſtract;</hi> verily, <hi>Man in his beſt eſtate
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:152821:133"/>is altogether vanity,</hi> Pſal. 39.5. Not onely thus, the Man, but every Man; not in his worſt, but beſt eſtate; not only in parts, but in every part, altogether vanity: and if Man, the very beſt of Creatures, how much more thoſe Creatures which God made for Man: What is Honour, but <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num nihil,</hi> a glorious Fancy? <hi>Acts</hi> 25.23. What is Wealth, but a little white and red Earth? What is all pleaſure here, but a little bitter ſweet? <hi>Solomon</hi> that extracted the quinteſſence of all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, after the tryal of all, <hi>all is vanity and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Meditate on the <hi>uncertainty of them.</hi> 1 Tim. 16.17. <hi>Charge them that be rich, they truſt not in uncertain riches;</hi> So uncertain, as like Tennis-Balls, they are banded up and down from one to another; they cannot promiſe a day or an hours continuance to you, or you to them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5. Riches take to themſelves Wings, and fly away like a Partridge, in one mans Field to day, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers to morrow; many of great eſtates are on a ſudden brought to nought, by Fire, Water, Thieves: How often have you heard of ſuch and ſuch in honour to day, and diſgrace to morrow; a Rich Man one day, and a Beggar another; in health and jovial to day, and dead, nay (it may be) damned to morrow: be warned by others harms.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Meditate on the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſatisfactorineſs of them.</hi> They that have moſt of them, are never ſatisfied with them, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. Wherefore do you lay out your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for that which cannot ſatisfie? You have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it in all times: The Rich Fool in the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:152821:133"/>Goſpel, not content to have his Barns full, but he muſt pull them down to build them bigger: <hi>Abſalom</hi> not content to be a Kings Son, but he muſt aſpire alſo to his Fathers Throne: <hi>Ahab</hi> not content with a Kingdom, but is ſick after <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard. We need not look ſo far back, our lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times give us too ſad Examples; he that hath climed the Ladder of Preferment, high enough to break his neck, yet will indeavour to climb higher and higher, <hi>ut lapſu graviore ruat,</hi> that he may have the greater fall; he that by baſe and unjuſt Courſes hath ſcrapt together a great heap of Wealth, more then he knows well how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of, yet is ſtill labouring to add Houſe to Houſe, and Field to Field, and Bag to Bag, till he hath added Hell to all; he that hath run riot into all manner of exceſs, and even glutted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the pleaſures of the Fleſh, will yet be ſtill adding Drunkenneſs to Thirſt, and Fuel to the Fire of Concupiſcence, until he hath brought Poverty into his Eſtate, and Rottenneſs into his Body, and Deſtruction both upon Soul and Body; So unſatisfactory are all thoſe things here below; that like the Fire, Grave, Sea, and Hell, they have never enough.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Commonneſs of them.</hi> How that all theſe worldly things are common to the Wicked, as well as the Godly; God gives Riches to them to whom he will never give Grace here, nor Glory hereafter; Riches were never an evidence of Gods Love here, or Salvation hereafter; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Intereſt in Chriſt, and Grace from Him. Men may have Riches, and yet be damned; Heirs, and yet be damned; Gifts and Parts, and yet be
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:152821:134"/>damned; for all theſe earthly things are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the wicked with the Godly, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.1. and uſually wicked men enjoy more of them then the Godly, <hi>Job</hi> 2. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 73. becauſe it is their portion in this Life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. <hi>end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Take notice of the <hi>Unprofitableneſs of them.</hi> Mark 8.36. What will it profit a man to win the World and loſe his Soul; they cannot profit a Mans Perſon, neither his Soul, nor Body, nor his Poſterity; they may ſeem to profit in a day of Proſperity, but not of Adverſity, a day of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Calamity, Sickneſs, Death, Judgment. 1. They cannot profit or better a mans perſon; it may make him a worſe, but not a better man; he may conceit himſelf a better man, and the men of the World may eſteem him the better for his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of theſe things, his high Place, his brave Apparel, his great Revenues; but God eſteems no man the better for theſe things, <hi>Job</hi> 34.19. <hi>Job</hi> 36.19. 2. They cannot profit or better the Soul, hurt it they may, and do; as for inſtance; 1ſt. They keep them from looking after piety, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.18. 2ly, They diſtract them in duty, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. 3ly, It makes them unfruitful in duty, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.22. They may better his outward condition; he may eat more, and go finer, and lie eaſier; but they cannot better his inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, help to Pardon, or Peace, Grace, or Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Thou and thy Money periſh with thee, that thinkeſt the Gift of God may be purchaſed with Money, ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Acts 8.20. God will not give away his Graces (as the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> do their Gold) for Gaudes and Rattles, Toyes and Trifles. 3. Unprofitable to the Body. Can
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:152821:134"/>Honour or Wealth buy Health, or get a ſtomach to meat, or procure eaſe, reſt, and ſleep? No, we find by experience the contrary; he that hath moſt of theſe outward things, can but eat, and drink, and cloath himſelf; and ſo doth a poor man, and with more comfort and contentment, many times, then the Rich, and hath uſually a a better appetite to his meat, and more ſweet ſleep after his labour, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Job</hi> 20.22. 4. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable likewiſe to his Poſterity: How often have you ſeen after that men have toyled and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiled in the World all their dayes for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, their Children to be either ſuddenly ſnatcht away from their Wealth, or their Wealth from their Children: How often have you ſeen the Proverb made good, <hi>Covetous men have either Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals or Fools to their Children;</hi> ſuch as either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently conſume it away, or are ſoon cheated of all: If you would obſerve it, you may find many Parents bewailing their folly at the laſt, that they have toyled ſo much in the World for ſuch wicked and rebellious Children; and many Children curſing the time that ever their Parents left them ſo great and ill-gotten Eſtates, according to that <hi>Job</hi> 21.19. 5. However they may afford them ſome comfort in the day of proſperity, and in a day of peace, yet not in the time of Adverſity, and in a day of Calamity in a day of Sickneſs, Death, and Judgement. 1ſt. Not in a day of common Calamity, when the Judgments of God are upon the Land, Sword, Famine, Peſtilence, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.21. <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. <hi>laſt. Ezek.</hi> 7.19. 2ly, In Sickneſs; It is not high Places, honourable Titles, full Bags, great Revenues,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:152821:135"/>that can prevent or remove Stone, Gout, Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury, Feaver, or any Sickneſs or Pain; it's true, they may procure Phyſicians, and Medicines; but thoſe kill, rather then cure, without the Lord. 3ly, In the hour of Death, <hi>Job</hi> 27.8. What is the hope of the Hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his Soul? All the Rich Fools Wealth, could not keep his Soul one night longer, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.15, 20. 4ly, In the day of Judgment, all the World is ſo far from profiting, as they ſhall ſee all in fire about their ears, &amp; have nothing left but an account how they got, and kept, and imployed it; and the more they have had of this Worlds good, and the leſs good they have done with it; and the more they have abuſed it, the more and greater will be their torment. 5ly, All they have of the World, cannot ſave them from Hell, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.23. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. nor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate their torments there; <hi>Dives</hi> could not procure a drop of Water to cool his ſcorched tongue, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.24, 25. So as you ſee clearly and fully, what unprofitable and helpleſs things theſe of the World are without Grace, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not free from any thing that is truly evil, Sin or Pain; nor help to any thing that is truly good, Pardon or Peace; they cannot keep ſickneſs from the Body, or trouble from the Mind, or terrors from the Conſcience, or the Soul out of Hell; they may make men worſe, but never the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Think on the <hi>Deceitfulneſs of the things of the World.</hi> They do promiſe to men much help and comfort, or rather men promiſe to themſelves much by them, but both they and themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:152821:135"/>themſelves, and meet with bitterneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſweetneſs, and trouble inſtead of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, therefore called deceitful Riches, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.22. Like <hi>Jael,</hi> ſeeds men with Milk, but pierceth their heads and hearts afterwards with ſorrow; like <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> who ſalute with a Kiſs, but ſtab to the heart.</p>
               <p n="7">7. On the <hi>Hurtfulneſs of them:</hi> Eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got and kept by unlawful means, and uſed and imployed to unlawful ends, they keep them from a great deal of good, and expoſe them to a great deal of hurt. 1. They keep men from a great deal of good, as the minding the glory of God, and the good of Souls, both their own and others, keep them either from uſing the means of Grace, or from profiting by them, <hi>Ezek</hi> 33.31, 32. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.19. 2. Expoſe them to a great deal of evil, both of Sin and Puniſhment, the wrath and curſe of God and Man both here, and to all eternity in Hell, as you may ſee clearly, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>James</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. Hence it is that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſtiles them, not only <hi>Vanity,</hi> but <hi>vexation of Spirit,</hi> becauſe they are ſtill vexing men either with cares in getting, or fears in keeping, or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in loſing; and our Saviour compares them to Thorns, becauſe they are ſtill piercing both head and heart with troubles in getting, and grief in parting with them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Meditate on the <hi>great folly and madneſs of men, in minding, affecting, and purſuing theſe things of the World before, and more then the things of God, and Chriſt, and his Spirit, and Kingdom, and the wellfare of their own precious and immortal Souls:</hi> The Spirit of God brands them frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:152821:136"/>in the Scripture for <hi>Fools,</hi> or <hi>the Fools,</hi> and the <hi>worſt of Fools,</hi> Prov. 1.22. Mat. 23.17, 18. Luke 12.19, 20. and not without cauſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is a Fool that is not able to diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Copper and Gold, Pebles and Pearls, that will part with the richeſt Coyn, for the richeſt Counter; what are all temporal things, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of ſpiritual and eternal Excellencies, but droſs and dung, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, offal and Dogs-meat, in compariſon of Chriſt, Grace, and Glory, as the Apoſtle ſtiles them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is a Fool, you know, that minds onely things preſent, and nothing for the future; <hi>A wiſe man foreſees the evil and hides himſelf, but a fool paſſeth on and is puniſhed,</hi> Prov. 22.5. A wiſe man fore-ſees and fore-caſts his buſineſs, but a fool doth neither: And ſuch fools are all worldly wiſe men, all for this preſent World, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for another. I have read a ſtory of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain great Man, that having many Houſes, was wont every month to go from one Houſe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and ſend Harbingers before to make proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for him; at laſt falling ſick, and drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his end, a Servant of his came to viſit him, and asking him how he did, <hi>Oh,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am going to another World;</hi> Maſter (ſaid he) you were wont here to ſend Proviſion before you to your Houſes here, have you done ſo for another Houſe, your eternal Houſe? <hi>Oh no</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that is my folly and miſery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He is a fool that will hazzard and adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his life for a toy and a trifle, and put off a buſineſs for the preſent of greateſt conſequence, to another day, when yet he knows not whether he
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:152821:136"/>ſhall have another day; and yet this is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt folly of worldly wiſe men, though they hear often that there's but one thing neceſſary in the World, in compariſon whereof all other things are unneceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Salvation of the Soul,</hi> yet will hazzard that, to gain the World, and put off that to the laſt and weakeſt hour, when they can ſcarce think upon any thing elſe but pain; and then when 'tis too late, lament their great folly and madneſs in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Meditate on the duties you ow to God for the Creatures, and the uſes you are to make of the Creatures; I ſhall but name a few: As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To contemplate thoſe glorious Attributes of God, which ſhine forth in the Creatures, as his Eternity, Omnipotency, infinite Wiſdom, and unſearchable goodneſs to Mankind, in making a World, and all things in it for him, and him for himſelf; and that, firſt, Becauſe it's expreſly commanded, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.13. <hi>Job</hi> 37.14. 2. The practiſe of the Saints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.11, 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.5, 6. all Gods People, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.2. 3. Becauſe it's the end wherefore God made Man, and gave him a reaſonable Soul; not onely that he ſhould barely view the Creatures, but contemplate his glorious Attributes that ſhine forth in them. There's no skilful Artificer that will take it well to have his skill not taken notice of in the works he doth; much leſs will God, and it will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly agravate mens ſin and condemnation at laſt, that they have ſo much taken notice of, and admired the works of men, and ſo little taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the great and glorious Works of God in
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:152821:137"/>the Creation of this glorious Fabrick of Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Duty, to learn thoſe good things in the Creatures, which they do teach us in, and by the inſtinct of Nature: for all the World is but a great School, to teach us the knowledge of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Creatio Mundi Scriptura Dei, Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Mundus, Deus Explicatus,</hi> (as one ſaith well) The whole Creation is a Scripture of God, the Heaven, the Earth, and the Sea.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Great Leaves of that Book; the Creatures contained in them, as ſo many Lines, by which God would read a Divinity-Lecture to us, all the Creatures but a Ladder made of many ſteps to raiſe us up to God, and as it were, a pair of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles, whereby we may read God, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible things of God more clearly and plainly, <hi>Jenkins</hi> on <hi>Jude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>what are thoſe things the Creatures teach us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They all teach us Obedience, Love, Unity, and dependance upon God, a deſire of freedom from that bondage our ſin hath brought upon them.</p>
               <p n="1">[1.] They all teach us <hi>Obedience</hi> to God, for they all keep their ſtation in which God hath ſet them; they all do what God commands them, and leave undone what he forbids them. 1. They all keep their ſtation; the Sun rejoyceth to run its courſe, the Sea keeps within its Banks, the Earth ſtandeth faſt upon her Foundation; onely Man is fallen from it. 2. They do whatſoever God commands them; Pſal. 19.1. <hi>The Heavens declare the Glory of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Sea, and the Winds,</hi> and all <hi>fulfil his Word,</hi> Pſal. 148.8. 3. They
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:152821:137"/>leave undone what he forbids them; the Fire burns not, the Sea ſtands on heaps, the Sun ſtands ſtill, and goes backward ten degrees; the Fire deſcends, and the Water aſcends at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; all the Creatures have an ear to hear their Creator, only Man is deaf: Yea, (and mark farther) they not onely obey their Creator, but they obey him in a right manner: For, 1. they ſerve him only, and not us any further and longer then we ſerve him; therefore he is called the Lord of Hoſts, becauſe all is at his command, to teach us, as to obey him, ſo him only, and men no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they obey God. 2. They ſerve him chearfully, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 19. The Sun rejoyceth as a Gyant to run his courſe; and ſo ought we, for the abundance of all his goodneſs to us, or elſe are threatned to ſerve our enemies in the want of all things, <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.8. 3. They ſerve him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly day and night, and are never weary of doing him ſervice; ſo neither ought we, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>laſt. Be ſtedfaſt, unmoveable,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Be not weary of well doing,</hi> &amp;c. 4. They ſerve the Lord freely, by the inſtinct of Nature; how much more ſhould we by the inſtinct of Grace. 5. They waſte and conſume themſelves in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of us, to teach us to ſpend our ſelves, and be ſpent for God.</p>
               <p n="2">[2.] They all teach us <hi>to love God,</hi> as being all fruits and tokens of his love to us; and refuſe to love us, if we neglect to love him; the Sun de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies its Shine, the Clouds their Rain, and the Earth its Fruits; they teach us alſo as to love God, ſo to love others for God's ſake, eſpecially thoſe that are nearly related to us; for they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:152821:138"/>love thoſe of the ſame kind, and are very tender over their Mates, and to their young ones.</p>
               <p n="3">[3.] They all teach us <hi>unity</hi> amongſt our ſelves, for they all combine and conſpire in one, for the good of the whole; they all prefer the good of the whole, above their own particular: the Fire will deſcend, and the Waters aſcend, rather then there ſhall be a <hi>vacuum</hi> in Nature; though they be of contrary qualities, yet they do not trouble, but help one the other; the Fire warms the Air, the Air preſerves the Water, the Water moiſtneth the Earth; one Element is a good Neighbour to the other, and all to teach us, we ſhould not be hurtful, but helpful one to another, and prefer the publick, before our own private good.</p>
               <p n="4">[4.] They all teach us <hi>dependance on God,</hi> for being, and well-being, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.9, 10. <hi>The eyes of all things look up to thee,</hi> &amp;c. To teach us to look up to God, and to have our dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, for our ſelves and ours, and to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful about nothing, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.26. <hi>to the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">[5.] They all teach us a <hi>deſire and longing, to be freed from that bondage our ſins have brought upon them and our ſelves,</hi> Rom. 8.19, 22. And ſhall the Creatures ſigh and groan under our burdens, and we not under our own?</p>
               <p>A third Duty, is this, To bewail the firſt ſin of ours, which brought ſuch vanity and vexation upon the Creatures: God at firſt looked down upon all that he had made, and loe it was all very good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>laſt.</hi> uſeful and profitable to man; but no ſooner had Man ſinned, but all became,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:152821:138"/>not onely vain and unprofitable, but vanity of vanities, and vexation of ſpirit, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="4">4th <hi>Duty,</hi> Take heed you do not give thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to the Creature, which are due onely to God, as our Love, Fear, Deſire, Delight, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Hope, Confidence; for this is to rob God of his Glory and give it to the Creature; that which is expreſly forbid, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. therefore to take heed of it: And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To take heed of inordinate love to them, ſo as to be unwilling to part with them at the call and command of God; for this is to love the Gift more then the Giver; and this is no other then ſpiritual Idolatry and Adultery, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. &amp; <hi>James</hi> 4.4. This alſo the next and readieſt way to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of them, and to have a croſs, if not a curſe, in them: Beſides, if you love them too much, be ſure you will grieve the more when they are taken from you, and be made to wiſh you had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loved them ſo much, for then you ſhould not have grieved ſo much, and by both, ſo diſhonour God, diſgrace Profeſſion, and bring diſtempers upon your ſelves, and therefore love not the World, nor the things of the World, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Theſe are many and weighty, though little known, and leſs practiſed by the moſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mind them well.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To admire the wonderful love of God, in honouring us with ſuch glorious and bleſſed Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; not only vouchſafing his own protection, and the protection of his Son and Spirit, but alſo of his bleſſed Angels; Is not this matter of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? what are the Angels, but the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Creatures in the World, the glorious Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Heaven? No Prince on Earth hath ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Guard, as every Saint, even the pooreſt
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:152821:144"/>hath, every day and night, and therefore to be ſtill admiring and adoring this wonderful love of God, and ſay, Lord, what is Man, and I among the Sons of Men, that thou ſhouldeſt honour me ſo far, as to give thy Angels a charge to miniſter to me, and watch over me every day and night.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To glory in this priviledge, above all other priviledges in the World, that we have ſuch high and excellent Creatures to miniſter to us, and to be our Guardians. If men have a great and long Train at theit heels, of great and Noble Perſons, in Silk and Sattin, and Golden Chains, how do they run after them, and gaze upon them; whereas, alas, all this bravery is but beggery to the Glory of thoſe that wait upon the Saints; they have higher and more glorious attendance, thoſe noble and glorious Courtiers of Heaven: men need a fair day, and a clear Sun-ſhine, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their bravery, or half the ſhew of it is loſt; but now nothing can darken the glory of the Saints attendance; Mat. 28.2, 3. <hi>And behold, there was a great Earth-quake, for the Angel of the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from Heaven, and came and rolled back the ſtone from the door, and ſat upon it; his countenance was like Lightning, and his Raiment white as Snow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take heed you do not injure any, the leaſt of God's Saints, the pooreſt, meaneſt, moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible of them: Why? Becauſe they have the glorious Angels to wait upon them, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unto them; <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. <hi>See that thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not one of theſe little ones, for I ſay unto you, the Angels behold the Face of my Father.</hi> Why ſhould any think them unworthy of their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:152821:144"/>and countenance, when the greateſt Angels think them worthy of their attendance and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; if any wrong them, the Angels will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly right them. When the <hi>Sodomites</hi> roſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Lot,</hi> the Angel ſmote them with blindneſs, and reſcued <hi>Lot</hi> out of their hands. If <hi>Balaam</hi> go about to curſe God's <hi>Iſrael,</hi> an Angel ſtands in the way with a drawn Sword to withſtand him; If proud <hi>Sennacherib</hi> threaten to deſtroy <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and his People, an Angel goes forth and ſlayes, in one night, a hundred eighty and five thouſand in his Army. And therefore take heed of wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of them any way.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Be quickned hence to honour and ſerve that God more chearfully, that hath ſo highly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and incouraged you in the ſervice of him, as to appoint the Glorious Angels to attend upon you in it; ſhall they that are ſo high and holy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove us, ſtoop ſo low as to attend upon us, and Miniſter to us, at God's command, and ſhall not we, who are ſo inferior to him, readily do ſervice to him, who is ſo high above us, and hath no need of our ſervice, and whoſe ſervice cannot any way reach to him, but only to our ſelves? And when our honour and happineſs is wrapt up in it; what a ſhame were this, and what an aggravation will this be upon all idle Servants at the laſt day!</p>

God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them down to Hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What their ſpecial ſin was, is not clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Scripture, but probably conceived to be their pride, from that place, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. where he adviſeth, That a Miniſter ſhould not be a Novice, leſt being lifted up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of the Devil; implying, that their ſin was either pride, or mixed with pride.</p>

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:152821:148"/>whereas by Creation they had the Knowledge of of God's whole Will, and an actual conformity to it; by their fall they were deprived, though not of their Natural, yet of their Supernatural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and all Sanctified Knowledge; and this Knowledge they have now, it is accompanied with an implacable hatred of God, and obſtinate impenitency, and final deſperation. The ſecond part of their puniſhment is, The Curſe of God, or the Infinite and Eternal Wrath of God, which St. <hi>Peter</hi> layes down in four branches; Having ſinned, 1. They were caſt down, <hi>viz.</hi> out of Heaven. 2. Caſt into Hell. 3. Under ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Chains of Darkneſs. 4. Reſerved to the Day of Judgement, for the full pouring out of God's Wrath and Vengeance upon them. In the interim, they are permitted to come out of that local place of Hell, and to walk up and down in the World, for the puniſhment of the wicked, and the exerciſing of the Godly.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>To take notice what their Office and Work is;</hi> And that is, To be a Tempter, an Accuſer, a Tormentor; theſe three the Devil is continually exerciſed in. 1. He is a continual tempter unto ſin, and therein behaves himſelf as a ſubtil Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and diſcovers himſelf to be that wicked One. 2. He is a continual Accuſer of God to Man, and Man to God, and one Man to another; and therein ſhews himſelf to be a Deceiver, and a Murderer, and the Father of Lies, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. 3ly, He is a continual Tormentor and Troubler of men for ſin; and therein ſhews himſelf a Fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Dragon, and a Roaring Lion, and <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:152821:149"/>him to be imployed in, in a double reſpect. 1. The Wicked; and, 2. the Godly; to puniſh the one, and exerciſe the other. 1. To puniſh and plague the wicked. 1. In their Souls; and that 1. by giving the Devils power to tempt them to ſin, and prevail over them by his temptations, as over <hi>Ahab</hi>'s falſe Prophets, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.22. 2ly, By giving power to them, to vex and to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie their Conſciences, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.14, 23. An E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Spirit was ſent to vex <hi>Saul;</hi> and <hi>Pſalm</hi> 78.49. Evil Angels were ſent to vex and terrifie the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians.</hi> 2. To puniſh them in their bodies, by giving leave to the Devil to poſſeſs them and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them, rend and tear them in pieces, as Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tells us he hath done the bodies of many wicked Hereticks, Blaſphemers, and Apoſtates; and at laſt to carry them to Hell, as he did <hi>Dives,</hi> Luke 16. Then, 2ly. their Office is to exerciſe the Godly: 1. Sometimes in their Bodies, by afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, as he did <hi>Job</hi>'s Body, <hi>Job</hi> 2.7. 2. In their Souls, by ſuffering Satan to tempt them, and trouble them, though not finally prevail over them, as over the wicked; however Satan ſought to winnow <hi>Peter</hi> like Wheat, yet Chriſt prayed that his Faith ſhould not fail, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.32. Though he buffeted <hi>Paul,</hi> yet God promiſed his Grace ſhould be ſufficient for him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 9.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. For their <hi>Knowledge;</hi> That muſt needs be very great. 1. In that by creation they were like to the good Angels in Knowledge. 2. Their knowledge ſince hath been much increaſed by the

But yet however they know ſo much, and more of God then others, yet they know not mens hearts, but only by conjecture, for 'tis only God's prerogative to be the ſearcher of the heart, 1 <hi>King</hi> 8.39. Neither do they know what the Grace of Regeneration is, nor what the comforts of the Spirit are, for theſe are props to the Elect.</p>

In the obſerving every ones Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Diſpoſition, Place, Imployments, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, ſuiting his temptations accordingly. 2. In that he maketh choice of the fitteſt Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to accompliſh his deſigns, and thereby hath prevailed over the wiſeſt men, as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</hi> 3.

That he is ſo powerful, appears, 1. In that he can hurry their Bodies up and down in the Air, as he did Chriſts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.29,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:152821:150"/>33. 2. In that he can raiſe Tempeſts, <hi>Job</hi> 1.16, 19. 3. In that he can bring Diſtempers on the Body, and on the Mind, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.16. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.31. 4. In that he can overthrow Houſes and Buildings, <hi>Job</hi> 1.18. 5. Break Chains and Bars, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.4. 6. Stir up Humors of Luſt and Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, as in the <hi>Sodomites;</hi> any thing that is within the compaſs of Nature, or may be done by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral means: But yet here's our comfort, though he be ſo ſtrong, Chriſt is ſtronger, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.4. and he hath bruiſed his Head, ſpoiled Principalities and Powers; he hath ſo limited his Power, that he cannot do what he would; as for inſtance, 1. He cannot work Miracles, that is, ſuch things as are above, and contrary to Nature, for that is God's Prerogative; it's true, he may counterfeit them, as he did by the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sorcerers, but not work any true Miracle, that being proper to God; whence the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sorcerers were forced to ſay of thoſe true Miracles God did by the hand of <hi>Moſes, This is the Finger of God,</hi> Exodus 8.19. 2ly, He cannot force the Will of Man, for this is contrary to the Nature of the Will to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and therefore they wrong the Devil, that lay the blame of their evil practiſes on the Devil, for he could never force them to ſin, without their conſent; he muſt have a double commiſſion, firſt from God, and then from men, before he can draw them into ſin. 3. He cannot do any thing that naturally he hath power to do without the Lord's Permiſſion, for he could not touch <hi>Job</hi>'s Body, until the Lord gave him leave, <hi>Job</hi> 2.6, 7. nor ſo much as enter into the Swine, till Chriſt gave him leave, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.31.</p>

All ſin hath its rice from Satan, either in whole or in part; the firſt ſin that ever was committed in the World, was by his inſtigation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1, 2. and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſin is ſtill conceived or committed by any creature, the Devil has ſome hand in bringing it to paſs; whence ſins are called the Works of the Devil, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. becauſe he works together with men, and hath a hand one way or other in drawing men to ſin, as <hi>David</hi> to number the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1. and <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> to lie unto the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3. But yet here ſtill remember, though the Devil hath a hand in every ſin, it doth not excuſe the ſinner, becauſe however he tempts, yet he cannot compel to ſin, only perſwades to it by Arguments: for every man is tempted, when he is drawn aſide by his own

The greateſt Enemy to man, ſeeing his malice cannot reach ſo high as God, therefore (like the Panther, of whom it's ſtoried, he will fly upon the Picture of Man) he will bend his utmoſt malice and rage againſt man, who was created after the Image of God, and had a Redeemer vouchſafed to him, and not to them. 3. The greateſt Enemy to all the Creatures for God's ſake, and Man's ſake, ſo that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them all, were it in his power, and God did not reſtrain him; ſeeing he cannot do the miſchief he would to them, he will vex them and torment them what he can, as he did the poor Swine whom he carried headlong into the Sea.

                  <p n="3">3. Not to fear him too much, ſo as to be kept from duty, or drawn into ſin by him; for this is to worſhip the Devil inſtead of God, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to leave you unto his power, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to take heed of fearing him with ſuch a ſlaviſh fear as to be kept from duty, and to be drawn into evil; remember and conſider well, however the Devil be full of ſubtilty, malice, and power, yet Chriſt he is the Wiſdom of the Father, and knows how to out-wit him, and to out-work him; <hi>Greater and ſtronger is he that is in you, then he that is in the World,</hi> 1 John 4.4. He hath already ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, tryumphing over them on the Croſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. Hath them all in a Chain, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. ſo as they cannot go an inch far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then their Chain; can do nothing without his permiſſion, not ſo much as enter into a Swine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his leave; however they may prevail over wicked men, to carry them, Souls and Bodies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſtruction, yet they cannot over true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:152821:154"/>ſuch as he hath reſcued out of his power; <hi>I have prayed that thy Faith fail not,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Peter</hi>) and not only for him, but all others that believe in his Name, <hi>John</hi> 17.20. The Devil may prevail ſometimes by God's permiſſion, to the ſpoiling of their Goods, the afflicting of their Bodies, the troubling of their Spirits, yea (and it may be) the loſs of their life, but never to the prejudice or loſs of their Soul; God may give way to them to let them ſeparate us from worldly things, but never from the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To carry our ſelves ſo, as we may ſtill be protected from the power, malice, and rage of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and his Inſtruments, to this end, To take heed of ſome things, and practiſe others. 1. To take heed of theſe things, that as you do not fear him too much, ſo you do not ſlight him too much, much leſs provoke him, and ſeek for help from him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not to ſlight him too much, ſo as to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, ruſh upon his temptations and preſume on your own ſtrength of Grace to withſtand them; for if he had ſo much power over man in the ſtate of Innocency to give him a fall, much more in the ſtate of Apoſtacy; as you may ſee in the Examples of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> if he hath ſhaken the talleſt Cedars, much more ſuch poor low ſhrubs as we are.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As not to ſlight him too much, ſo not to provoke him too much, as many ignorant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane wretches do, by reviling and railing on him, daring and challenging him, he ſhould do his worſt, raſhly and indiſcreetly ruſhing into
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:152821:155"/>thoſe places given up to his poſſeſſion, for this is but fool-hardineſs, and many have ſadly ſmarted for it; therefore take warning by others harm. You may read <hi>Jude</hi> 9. The Arch-Angel would not rail at the Devil, but only ſaid, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee;</hi> this being ſpoken in Faith, will ſoon quell him and ſubdue him, rather then railing tearms: Remember, and conſider, the Devil is forward enough to do miſchief, and needs not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Above all, take heed you be never drawn to ſeek help from him in the time of trouble and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, as many ignorant prophane perſons are: For,</p>

Theſe are the ſeveral pieces of Defenſive Armour.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="2">2ly, For the Offenſive Armour, or the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons you are to uſe, they are two, the <hi>Sword of the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God; you muſt not ſuffer this to ſleep in the Scabbard, but weld it againſt Satan, as Chriſt did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. <hi>Thus it is written, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To take the other Weapon, Prayer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Sword of the Spirit will do little
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:152821:156"/>good; for as it was ſaid of <hi>Scanderbegs Sword,</hi> it would do little without <hi>Scanderbegs Arm;</hi> is much more true of this, it will do us but little good without the Lord's Arm; and therefore ſtill to ply the Throne of Grace, for his Spirit to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with his Word, and by it to give you power and victory over Satan.</p>
                  <p>Having thus furniſhed your ſelves with Armour and Weapons, you muſt ſtand upon your Watch. Had you an Enemy that were potent and politick, that watched every opportunity to do you miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, you would heedfully keep your watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, would you not? how much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Satan, the Adverſary, an Enemy ſo full of Power and Policy, and that continually walks up and down like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour.</p>
                  <p>And here, that you may keep your Watch; 1. You muſt be careful to avoid all thoſe things which may give him an occaſion to tempt you, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially theſe two, <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> and <hi>Evil Company;</hi> for your own, as well as others experience, will tell you, by theſe the Devil moſt prevails, and therefore to watch againſt them, as the wiſe Man exhorts you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.8. &amp; 23.31.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You are to hearken to the counſel of <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8. <hi>Be ſober, and watch;</hi> without ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, no watchfulneſs: Intemperancy in the uſe of the creature expoſeth men to ſleep, rather then to watch; and therefore if you would be able to keep your Watch, you muſt be ſober, that is, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in your deſires to, and in the uſe of all Creature-comforts, Honours, Riches, Pleaſures, becauſe theſe are the Baits under which he hides his
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:152821:157"/>Hooks of Temptation that they may not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; and therefore, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Let your mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be known in all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third direction; You muſt reſiſt him in all his temptations, eſpecially unto thoſe ſins you are moſt inclin'd to, by your particular Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Places and Callings, and then the Promiſe is, he ſhall fly, <hi>James</hi> 4.7. That you may do this the more effectually, have an eye to two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. The right manner of reſiſting him, that is thus, <hi>Speedily, Univerſally, Couragiouſly, Self-denyingly, Wiſely,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Speedily,</hi> in the firſt injection of any evil motion, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.26. <hi>Give no place to the Devil; no lodging to any evil thought,</hi> Jer. 4.14. For if this old Serpent get in his head, he will ſoon draw in his body after; therefore to break his head by withſtanding the firſt motion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Reſiſt him <hi>Univerſally</hi> in every temptation, the leaſt as well as the greateſt; take heed you do not ſlight him, becauſe it is a ſmall one; a ſmall leak may ſink a Ship as well as a great, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſin ſink a Soul to Hell as well as a great, where it is allowed of, and liv'd in, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.19.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Reſiſt him <hi>Couragiouſly,</hi> ſeeing your Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hath given him his deaths wound, ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, and made a ſhew of it openly, tryumphing over them on the Croſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Do it <hi>Self-denyingly,</hi> going out of your ſelves, and labouring to be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.10.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Do it <hi>Wiſely,</hi> ſo as to obſerve what he moſt aims at, for he uſeth to fit his temptation to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:152821:157"/>ones diſpoſition, and obſerves what every one moſt loves and delights in.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Do it <hi>Conſtantly,</hi> not giving over until you have got the victory, for the promiſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is only to thoſe that overcome, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. There is no ſafety in flying, no piece of Armour for the back, and therefore to chuſe rather to die manfully, then fly cowardly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>laſt. If any draw back, my Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, To furniſh your ſelves with Arguments, whereby you may be enabled to reſiſt all his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to ſin, ſuch as theſe; the purity of God's Nature; the ſeverity of God's Juſtice; the ugly, hateful, hurtful nature of ſin; the dear price that was paid for the expiating of it; the terrible threatnings of God againſt ſin; the many preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes God hath made to ſuch as deny themſelves in it, and the certainty of victory, if we continue to fight againſt it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. <hi>to the end.</hi> And thus of the Remedies againſt the Temptations of Satan in general.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſhall give you a few directions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his hideous and helliſh temptations to Atheiſm, Blaſphemy, Self-murder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo conclude this Subject: And here,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Take notice that there is no temptation that befals any, but is common to all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. and therefore let not the Devil perſwade you none have ſuch wicked thoughts as you, for <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.19. <hi>As in Water face anſwers to face, ſo doth the heart of one man unto another,</hi> even the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:152821:158"/>every one being equally corrupted by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's God's uſuall manner, when he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to convert any, and pull them out of the ſnare of the Devil, to let looſe Satan upon them, to exerciſe and afflict them with the injection of ſuch hideous helliſh thoughts of Atheiſm, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, Self-murder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ſo he may humble them the more thorowly, and work them to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration of their ſpiritual and eternal condition.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider Chriſt was aſſaulted with ſuch A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical blaſphemous ſelf-murdering thoughts, as you may ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. from 1, to 11. and he was tempted with them, that he might have a fellow-feeling of your infirmities, and know how to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor you under your temptations, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. <hi>end.</hi> and here is our comfort, he hath vanquiſht him for us, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. therefore to reject him ſtedfaſtly in the Faith, the promiſe is, <hi>He ſhall fly and fall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. When Satan would tempt you to deſpair, becauſe of the hideouſneſs and helliſhneſs of theſe thoughts; remember him of what Chriſt told him, that <hi>he was a lyar and a murderer in it,</hi> John 8.44. For it is not the multitude or greatneſs of ſin can ſhut any from Mercy, but onely unbelief and impenitency; be but willing to ſee and leave ſin, and you cannot deſire ſo much mercy, but there is infinitely more in God for you; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6, 7. <hi>Let the wicked man forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, &amp;c.</hi> Oh but ſaith the Devil, This promiſe is made onely to ſuch as turn from their wicked thoughts, but you do not, you have
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:152821:158"/>ſwarms of wicked thoughts ariſing in your minds, and therefore you cannot expect a pardon. Tell Satan he is a lyar in this, for though they ariſe there, they have no entertainment there, which is only that which God condemns, <hi>Jer</hi> 4.14. No man can keep a Bird from flying over his head, but he may from neſtling there; ſo however you cannot keep Satan from injecting ſuch wicked thoughts, yet you may and ought to reſolve in and thorow the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt, not to give way to them; and ſo long as you do ſo, know in the next place,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Theſe atheiſtical and blaſphemous thoughts, they are only your croſſes, but Satans ſins, they ſhall never be charged on you ſo long as you hate them, and are burden'd with them; however, there be much of your corruption in them, God will never impute that which you do not allow of, as the Apoſtle comforts himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil I do, I allow not, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. If you would get power and victory over theſe helliſh injections, you muſt take notice of Satans drift and ſcope in them, and labour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint him in it. His ſcope is, To rob God of the glory of his Grace, and either keep you from duty, or diſtract you in it, and make you weary of it, and therefore to croſs him in his end; which that you may do, mind well theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That you do not conceal but reveal unto ſome wiſe, faithful, experienced Miniſter or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, what it is that doth ſo much trouble you, that they may adviſe and direct you what to do, in and under ſuch a temptation; and when you do it, take heed you do not like the Lapwing, cry
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:152821:159"/>fartheſt from the Neſt; reveal ſome things, but conceal that which chiefly troubles you, for that will but keep &amp; encreaſe your trouble, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be faithful to God and others, and your own Souls, in your confeſſions and complaints of your corruptions and temptations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Take heed you do not reaſon with Satan a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe wicked thoughts that ſo much trouble you, for he is too old and cunning a Sophiſter to parley with, and will be ſure to diſquiet you the more.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When ſuch atheiſtical blaſphemous wicked thoughts ariſe, though you are to be humbled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and lift up an ejaculation for pardon and power over them; yet take heed, be not over dejected and caſt down by them, ſo as to caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way your confidence; for the more he ſeeth you are afflicted with them, the more he will inject them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The more he labours, by his injections, to keep you from duty, and diſtract in duty, do you labour to be the more forward to duty, and intent in duty; and when he ſees that he is ſlighted, he will trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you the leſs, and grow weary of his injections.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When ſuch wicked thoughts ariſe in your mind, labour to croſs them with the contrary good thoughts, and that you ſhall find will abate much the power of them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Take notice of, and make Conſcience of thoſe duties which God requires of you, in order to your victory over ſuch helliſh temptations to atheiſm and blaſphemy, and the like; as theſe, 1. Patiently to ſubmit unto God's correcting hand, and take heed of breaking forth into paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:152821:159"/>or any unſeemly carriage under them, as the Prophet gives you an example, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.9. 2. Be thankful to God that it is not worſe with you, and that you find any ſupport under them, as you may find the Church was, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22, 23. 3. Be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſtay and wait God's time, till he come and take off Satan, and ſpeak peace unto you, for it is only he can do it, and not Men nor Angels, as you may ſee clearly, <hi>Job</hi> 34.29. and he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to do it in his time, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.11. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.7, 8. And therefore to wait his time, as the Saints have done before you, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 85.8. <hi>I will hearken what God will ſpeak, &amp;c.</hi> If you thus wait upon the Lord, the Lord will wait to be gracious unto you, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. and will ſhortly tread Satan under your feet, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. and either ſpeak peace to you on Earth, or for ever in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.2. And therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, let me perſwade you to hearken unto, and follow the counſel of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. <hi>Who is there amongst you that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the Voice of his Servant, walks in darkneſs and ſees no light? let him truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay himſelf upon his God:</hi> So long as you are ſuch as fear to ſin againſt the Lord in the leaſt thing, and are careful to obey the Voice of his Servant, in the miniſtry of his Word, the Lord himſelf tells you, He is your God; and your duty is, to truſt in his Name, and to ſtay your ſelves upon him for Light and Comfort, Pardon and Peace, Salvation and Deliverance from Sin and Satan, and all the powers of Darkneſs. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Orderly.</hi> Begin with God, and then go on day after day with the other Heads, until you have gone through all, and meditate on one thing one day, and another thing another day: And becauſe your memory is weak, take your Book to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and call things to your remembrance, and make choice of that Subject which may be moſt ſeaſonable and ſuitable to the preſent occaſion, and your own and others neceſſity.</p>

                  <p>When you are to go to wait an God in the uſe of his Ordinance, think what a mercy it is to have the Doors of God's Sanctuary open, when they are ſhut to others; to ſee Souls flock to the Ordinances, as the Doves to the Windows; that ſome Souls might ſtill be added to the Church, and brought into Chriſt; and built up further in Grace and gracious practices: When you are to hear the Word, remember you are not only to hear a Man but God, who ſpeaks in and by Man, who hath ſaid, His Word ſhall not return in vain, but ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proſper to the end he ſends it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. <hi>last.</hi> And if it be not the ſavour of Life, it will of Death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>end.</hi> When the Sermon is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, remember, though the Miniſter have done, the Sermon is not done, until you have done and

                  <p>When you are walking abroad, and meet with any Chriſtian Friend, think if it be ſweet with a dear Chriſtian Friend upon Earth, Oh how ſweet will it be to meet with all in Heaven? When you hear of any good news from them, then think, Oh what good news hath Chriſt brought from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and did the Angel ſing at the time of his Birth, and hath the Spirit of God brought home and ſpoken unto my heart; if it be bad news that you have heard, yet think and comfort your hearts with this, However you have ſad expectations from Earth, yet you have comfortable expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Heaven, God, and Chriſt, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is yours, and will be for ever yours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt.

When you hear of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies or dreadful appearances of God in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or the Earth, or the Sea, then think and ſay, How terrible, O Lord, art thou in all thy wayes! Who knows the power of thy anger! what mean theſe dreadful tokens of thy diſpleaſure make me and all to fear and tremble before thee! When you ſee or hear the corruption of men to break out into Drunkenneſs, Uncleanneſs, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, Perſecution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then think and ſay as <hi>Bradford</hi> the Martyr, <hi>Lord, what a wicked heart have I, what cauſe have I to give glory to Grace that keeps under corruption in me, that does not break
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:152821:167"/>out in me as in others.</hi> When any croſs or affliction befals you on the day, in Body, Soul, Name, Eſtate, think &amp; ſay, Lord what ſin is it that thou correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt? ſhew me my ſin, ſanctifie this affliction, and do me good by it: When any mercy is renewed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you and yours, think and ſay, Oh how great is that goodneſs thou haſt laid up for them that fear thee, and that thou workeſt daily for the Children of men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.</p>

                  <p>When the day draweth towards an end, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you are nearer to your end by one day, then you were in the morning; as the night approacheth towards you, ſo do you to the Grave, and for ought you know may be your laſt day: When you look up and ſee the Stars appear in the Heaven, think thus, Though your life here be hid with Chriſt in God, yet when he ſhall appear, you ſhall appear with him in glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4. and then your bodies ſhall ſhine as the Stars, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. When you ſee the dark night to come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and you begin to light Candles, then think if outward darkneſs be ſo uncomfortable, how much more is the inward darkneſs of the Soul, and utter darkneſs in Hell! if the light of a Candle be ſo comfortable, how comfortable is the Life of Grace here, and will be the Life of Glory hereafter: When you are about to put off your Cloaths, think thus, It will not be long ere I muſt be uncloathed of this body of Sin and Death; and if I be ſo willing to the one, why
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:152821:167"/>not to the other, that I might be cloathed with my Houſe from Heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. And if I be ſo willing to go into Bed to take my reſt, that I may have renewed ſtrength for Body and Spirit to fit me for the ſervice of the next day, why ſhould I not be as willing, and more willing, at God's call, to lay down my body in the Grave, there to reſt from all ſinning, ſorrowing, ſuffering, and to be raiſed up at the laſt day with renewed and perfect ſtrength both in Soul and Body, to be ſtill ſerving and glorifying God to all Eternity. Remember ſtill, O my Soul, thy ſleep is but the Image of Death; the Bed, the Image of thy Grave; and the Sheets, of thy Winding Sheets; the biting of the Fleas, but the gnawing of the Worms on the Body; the crowing of the Cock in the morning, the ſounding of the Trump of God at the laſt day by the Voice of the Arch-An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel; <hi>Awake ye dead, and come to Judgment,</hi> Iſa. 57.2. 1 Theſſ. 4.16.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, When you are about to ſleep, labour to ſleep with precious thoughts of God, for ſuch as your thoughts are, when you are about to ſleep, ſuch will your thoughts be when you awake. When we rake up fire in the Aſhes at night, ſo we uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally find it in the morning; and ſuch, I ſay, as our thoughts are of God when we ſleep, will be when we awake. In a word, Think of your ſleeping in Jeſus, and your awaking and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him in glory in the morning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. And thus I have, as briefly as I could, with any profit to you, directed you how to make a Spiritual uſe of whatſoever preſents it ſelf to
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:152821:168"/>your ſenſes, from morning to evening, at home and abroad: What remains, but that we put in practice what we ſee to be our duty; motives to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and directions for it, you have had before. I need not add any more, onely this conſideration, there's a double uſe God expects we ſhould make of every Creature, a natural and a ſpiritual; and if we ſhould content our ſelves only with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural uſe, without the Spiritual, we ſhould loſe the one half, and the beſt half of that comfort in the Creature which God gave it for; and we ſhall do no more then natural carnal ſenſual men, yea the very Beaſts do; and therefore if we will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence our ſelves to be Chriſtians indeed, that mind the wellfare of our Souls as well as our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, then to apply our ſelves more then ever we have done to the practice of this ſweet, weighty, and profitable duty of Meditation, both Solemn and Occaſional. Which that we may, bleſſed Lord, thou who haſt put it into the heart of thy weak and unworthy Servant, to ſtudy and write theſe things, for the good and comfort of thy People; be thou graciouſly pleaſed, by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual working of thy Holy Spirit, to make them uſeful to all, into whoſe hands they ſhall come, for the promoting and carrying on the Work of Grace in their hearts and lives, and the furthering of their everlaſting Salvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh Lord, I pray thee let it not be in vain that this or any other help is afforded them, but do thou give ſucceſs to the weak endeavours of
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:152821:168"/>thy unworthy Servant, ſo as there may be glory to thee, profit to them, and comfort to him who hath found that grace in thy ſight, to be accepted and enabled to be any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental for their help and comfort in the way homeward to everlaſting life.</hi> This is, and ſhall be, the Prayer of</p>
